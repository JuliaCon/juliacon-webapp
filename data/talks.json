  "description": "QXGraphDecompositions is a Julia package for analysing and manipulating graph structures describing a tensor network. In this talk we will introduce, at a high level, the problem of tensor network contraction as a motivating use case for QXGraphDecompositions. We will then demonstrate some of the main functions defined in QXGraphDecompositions by using it to find an efficient solution to such a problem and highlight the algorithms it uses in the process. Namely, we demonstrate a wrapper function for the flow cutter algorithm for finding a tree decomposition of a graph and an implementation of a greedy method for solving the treewidth deletion problem. While these methods have important applications in the field of tensor networks, QXGraphDecompositions has potential to be used in other fields. For example, tree decompositions are frequently used in graph theoretic computations and have been used to identify interesting structures in social networks.",

Therefore cells can update in response to other cells changing, which happens in a Pluto notebook every time you run a cell. But what if these intelligent updates could also happen on-demand programmatically? \r\n\r\nIntroducing the new, experimental “What you see is what you REST” feature! (*WYSIWYR* for short.) Every global variable becomes an HTTP endpoint, and you can provide other global variables as parameters. Instead of experimenting with a model inside Pluto and then moving your code to an API script, your notebook _is_ an API, using reactivity to automatically create an execution model for each endpoint.\r\n\r\nWith this feature, interacting with Pluto notebooks from both outside and inside of other Pluto notebooks is revolutionarily simple. Everything from sharing models to writing custom web APIs with Julia is now possible, entirely from within Pluto, without having to transition from notebook code to “production code”.\r\n\r\nThis talk will demonstrate how to get started with WYSIWYR and use it in your own projects. By also explaining how the feature works, we hope to get experienced users interested in the feature.

  "description": "MiniZinc was designed with the aim to become a 'standard' Constraint Programming modelling language. As such, it is oriented towards logical and combinatorial constraints standardized in the Global Constraints Catalogue, but also supports continuous variables. The most important design criteria were expressiveness, while at the same time simplicity for practical implementation, and mechanisms for easy plugging of new solvers. The solver interface incorporates a low-level language FlatZinc (aka MPS for example), and a redefinition scheme for global constraints. The latter enables native handling of globals supported by a given solver, while applying default or solver-specific redefinitions for unsupported ones. Other solver technologies, such as SAT, local search, and MIP, have been interfaced, and several experimental interfaces exist, such as to quantum computing. The modelling system has enabled the annual solver competition MiniZinc Challenge since 2008.",

  "description": "Models with tunable parameters are ubiquitous throughout mathematical modelling -- they are essentially the name-of-the-game in statistics, machine learning, and many other areas.\r\nThere are many model-agnostic learning and approximate inference algorithms for finding said parameters, such as various flavours of gradient ascent and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, etc. Indeed, the development of such algorithms is the core goal of multiple fields.\r\nSeparately, many modelling frameworks have been developed that allow users to easily specify models (Flux.jl, Turing.jl, Tensorflow, PyTorch, JAX, etc), which are agnostic to the learning algorithm that is ultimately used.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this very pleasant separation-of-concerns story gets messy when we look at how these two classes of software interact with one another.\r\nLearning algorithm software typically wants to receive a \"flat\" vector of real-valued parameters (e.g. Optim.jl, AdvancedHMC.jl) from a model, while most modelling frameworks naturally represent a model in terms of a structured collection of parameters, often spread out through a large data structure of some kind.\r\nThe traditional solution has been to either adapt the learning algorithms to make them aware of the modelling software (e.g. Flux.jl), or implement custom functionality to generate flat representations of parameters from structured objects (e.g. Turing.jl).\r\n\r\nThis is where [ParameterHandling.jl](https://github.com/invenia/ParameterHandling.jl/) comes in.\r\nIt is a general framework designed to bridge the gap between these two worlds.\r\nAt its core is functionality which algorithmically generates mappings between structured and flat representations.\r\nThis functionality can be extended by users or package maintainers to handle new types, and it comes equipped with escape hatches to make working with existing modelling packages doable, without needing to modify said packages.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will\r\n1. show how to use ParameterHandling.jl as a user,\r\n2. show how you could extend it to handle a new type as a modelling package maintainer,\r\n3. show how you might make use of ParameterHandling.jl as a learning algorithm maintainer,\r\n4. discuss its current limitations, and how these related to other solutions available in the Julia ecosystem.",

  "description": "Solving optimization problems in a business setting can be a significant challenge. There is a constant tension between delivering quick prototypes to prove value and building robust tools.  \r\n\r\nAt Fonterra, a New Zealand dairy co-operative, one of our planning problems concerns organic milk production. Due to low volumes or organic-certified milk, organic production planning takes place outside the usual planning process.  The constraints around organic problems are complex, and there is considerable value to be derived from a quality plan. These factors make organic planning a perfect candidate for a stand-alone optimization project within the business. \r\n\r\nDuring this project, JuMP has been an invaluable tool in several ways. Using JuMP, it has been trivial to develop quick prototypes and experimental features, without sacrificing the robustness of the end-product.  JuMP enables our team to be creative during the process and try new things on the fly. We can quickly respond to feedback from end users, which helps build a close relationship and ensure the continued success of the project. JuMP is also a reliable tool for building larger optimization applications, enabling the Data Science team at Fonterra to easily incorporate different multi-objective optimization approaches, optional cuts and complex conditional constraints into the model. \r\n\r\nThanks to JuMP, we have been able to mitigate the problem outlined at the start of the abstract, and secure key user engagement through continuous proof of value while delivering robust software.",

  "description": "I'm developing the largest inference application I have ever seen. For any population, it estimates morbidity and mortality from disease, cast against a background of mortality, but this is measured across years for multiple ages. There are seven web pages of settings, and it can take a day to run. In some way, it's easy to test because it's an inverse problem, so I can create a correct answer, generate data, and see if the application finds the correct answer. What I want is a defensible claim that I've tested the seven pages of settings.\r\n\r\nMy first approach is to write tests for some important cases. These paradigmatic tests have to pass, and they tell stakeholders that the basics work well. I add to these some tests I know challenge the system. Beyond these two classes of tests are another set of less common techniques that help look for bugs where I don't expect them. These include random testing, concolic testing, and property-based testing. For this problem, let's focus on a simpler technique, combinatorial testing.\r\n\r\nCombinatorial testing is a careful selection of test arguments, designed to likely have good code coverage. If we picture a page of code, then any one call to a function will walk through that code, skipping parts of it when it fails an if-condition. A thorough set of tests should, at least, execute different parts of if-conditions. There must be some choice of inputs to the application that lead to every branch of the code. Some branches depend on two input arguments multiplied pairwise. Others may depend on a particular combination of three or four input arguments. It would be helpful to test each value of each option and, somehow, walk through all possible pairs of arguments or all possible triples of arguments, in order to cover all branches.\r\n\r\nIf we have twenty different options, each of which can take one of four values, we don't have to run twenty-times-four tests to try every value. We can pack them into only a few tests. What if we wanted to try all pairs of the first two values? For each pair, that's four-choose-two, or twelve, combinations of arguments, to make twelve tests for each pair, and there are twenty-choose-two pairs, but we can pack these together, too, so that each test case explores a lot of the code.\r\n\r\nThe algorithms in UnitTestDesign.jl use greedy optimization to construct short test suites to pack all-pairs testing into as few arguments as possible. For twenty arguments with four values each, it can pack every possible pair of arguments into thirty-seven test cases. There is some research support that all-pairs testing will do a good job of finding faults in code, but the same package can generate tests with higher coverage, where higher means all triples or quadruples of input values are included in test cases.\r\n\r\nMost implementations of all-pairs algorithms aren't easy to run in a unit-testing framework because they are web-based or proprietary. There are a few reasons for this. These algorithms need to deal with different argument types. They need to give the tester a way to say that, if a flag is false, then another argument can't take certain values, so they need a little domain-specific language. Julia handles those problems naturally and, further, is efficient at the greedy optimization to determine test cases. These can take time to generate.\r\n\r\nFor applications with many options, or functions with many arguments, generating a good set of test cases can be computationally intensive, so we rely on the testing framework to help us generate values when needed, save them, and load them later. In Julia, the packages for scratch space and artifacts give us a workflow for testing where we generate combinatorial values, save them to scratch, and upload them as artifacts for others to use.\r\n\r\nThe resulting approach is to create a set of tests, save them for reuse, and run them many times. Given the challenging problem of testing a large, slow application, we've begun to describe a paradigm from the field of test automation. The general approach is to create a bunch of tests, measure their coverage, select a set to run, and respond to failing tests by refining those tests until we've narrowed down the fault at their source. Parts of this general approach can be seen in random testing, concolic testing, and property-based testing. Compared with these, combinatorial testing is the art of starting with a really good guess.",

  "description": "The Distributed standard library exposes RPC primitives (remotecall) and remote channels for coordinating and executing code on a cluster of Julia processes. When a problem is simple enough, such as a trivial map operation, the provided APIs are enough to get great performance and \"pretty good\" scaling. However, things change when one wants to use Distributed for something complicated, like a large data pipeline with many inputs and outputs, or a full desktop application. While one *could* build these programs with Distributed, one would quickly realize that a lot of functionality will need to be built from scratch: application-scale fault tolerance and checkpointing, heterogeneous resource utilization control, and even simple load-balancing. This isn't a fault of Distributed: it just wasn't designed as the be-all-end-all distributed computing library for Julia. If Distributed won't make it easy to build complicated parallel applications, what will?\r\n\r\nDagger.jl takes a different approach: it is a batteries-included distributed computing library, with a variety of useful tools built-in that makes it easy to build complicated applications that can scale to whatever kind and size of resources you have at your disposal. Dagger ships with a built-in heterogeneous scheduler, which can dispatch units of work to CPUs, GPUs, and future accelerators. Dagger has a framework for checkpointing (and restoring) intermediate results, and together with fault tolerance, allows computations to safely fail partway through, and be automatically or manually resumed later. Dagger also has primitives to build dynamic execution graphs across the cluster, so users can easily implement layers on top of Dagger that provide abstractions better matching the problem at hand.\r\n\r\nThis talk will start with a brief introduction to Dagger: what it is, how it relates to Distributed.jl, and a brief overview of the features available. Then I will take the listeners through the building of a realistic, mildly complicated application with Dagger, showcasing how Dagger makes it easy to make the application scalable, performant, and robust. As each feature of Dagger is used, I will also point out any important caveats or alternative approaches that the listeners should consider when building their own applications with Dagger. I will wrap up the talk by showing the application running at scale, and talk briefly about the future of Dagger and how listeners can help to improve it.",

  "description": "In this talk we will show how we built a model checking library in a few lines of Julia by integrating an LTL manipulation library to the JuliaPOMDP ecosystem. With this library we can compute decision policies with probabilistic guarantees for various range of partially observable problems: drone surveillance, robot exploration, pedestrian avoidance for autonomous driving.\r\n\r\nThis lightning talk will be organized as follows:\r\n-  Introduction to the problem of POMDP/MDP model checking: quick overview of JuliaPOMDP [1]\r\n-  Introduction to linear temporal logic manipulation using Spot.jl [2]: Spot.jl is a wrapper of spot [3], a c++ library for LTL manipulation. The Julia wrapper is built using CxxWrap.jl. We will demonstrate some visual examples of how spot is used to convert a temporal logic formula into a finite state machine and how we can visualize it (material will be inspired from the Spot.jl tutorial but remodeled to fit the talk format).\r\n- Introduction to POMDPModelChecking.jl [4]: we will show how we can reuse the whole JuliaPOMDP ecosystem to solve model checking problems. Our library exposes two solvers (ModelCheckingSolver and ReachabilitySolver), which takes as input any Julia POMDP model and an LTL formula and outputs a policy. Internally, the solver creates a new POMDP model which is a composition of the original model, and a finite state machine created by Spot.jl. This new model can then be solved by any JuliaPOMDP planning algorithm. The theoretical justification of reformulating the model checking problem into a planning problem has been detailed in previous work [5].\r\n- Gallery: We will show visual examples of decision policies computed using POMDPModelChecking.jl on the rock sample POMDP problem [6].\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] https://github.com/JuliaPOMDP\r\n[2] https://github.com/sisl/Spot.jl\r\n[3] https://spot.lrde.epita.fr/index.html\r\n[4] https://github.com/sisl/POMDPModelChecking.jl\r\n[5] M.

  "description": "Thermodynamic models represent a key tool for a variety of applications; this includes the study of complex systems (electrolytes, polymers, pharmaceuticals, etc), process modelling and molecular design. However, it is not uncommon for thermodynamic models to involve hundreds of different components, especially with the more modern equations of state like those built from Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT), whose ability to model complex phenomena (such as hydrogen bonding and London dispersion interactions) comes at the cost of complicated mathematical formulation. Most implementations are often abstruse, if they are open to the public at all, which is likely to be the main reason for the high barrier to entry into the field. Beyond those mathematical functions, it is also an exercise in working out the physical properties by exploiting some thermodynamic relations, which may involve the use of highly non-linear solvers for problems with near-singular Jacobians, and solving for the global minima of a non-convex, non-linear problem. The actual execution tends to be application-specific and difficult to extend, even if one had a full understanding of the procedures that are traditionally written in FORTRAN.\r\n\r\nEnter Julia, a language that seems to provide the most natural realisation of every step of this process. OpenSAFT is a framework that makes it easy to build SAFT-type (or any free-energy-based) models such that researchers and enthusiasts alike will be able to focus on the actual thermodynamics and algorithms without worrying about the implementation. With the Julia culture that completely embraces Unicode identifiers and terse syntax for mathematical operations, we are able to create nearly one-to-one translations of the mathematical expressions in the literature to code, removing the layer of obfuscation that usually appears when writing high-performance code.\r\n\r\nDifferential programming is a concept that is extensively used in modern statistical-learning tools, but is still relatively unknown to a lot of the scientific community. We are now able to trivially obtain any-order derivatives of the Helmholtz free energy function, instead of having to work out the corresponding expressions for each model. Suddenly, it all becomes a plug-and-play solution where the user could just write out the model equations, and have OpenSAFT seamlessly obtain all the relevant properties. By careful selection of parameter types, nearly every part of the code can be easily modified or extended so that users will be able to take direct control of the solvers if necessary. This allows people to easily pry into the inner workings of thermodynamic equations of state and study how they can be set up and used.\r\n\r\nWith Julia, OpenSAFT has the potential to revolutionise thermodynamic research and education, and we think that this effort will also greatly help to bridge the gap between cutting-edge development in academia and actual practical use in industry. Perhaps it could also inspire scientists from other domains to invest in bringing over their work to Julia where everything “just works”.",

  "description": "# View5D\r\nThe Java viewer `View5D` has been integrated into julia with the help of `JavaCall.jl`.  The viewer has its full Java functionality which includes displaying and interacting with 5D data and a decent way of interaction from the Julia side (see section **Interaction with Julia** below). Generating up to three-dimensional histograms and interacting with them to select regions of interest in the 3D histogram but shown as a selection in the data. It allows selection of a gate `element` where thresholds can be applied to which have an effect on statistical evaluation (mean, max, min) in other `element`s if the `gate` is activated. It further supports multiplicative overlay of colors. This feature is nice when processed data (e.g. local orientation information or polarization direction or ratios) needs to be presented along with brightness data. By choosing a gray-valued and a  constant brightness value-only (HSV) colormap for brightness and orientation data respectively, in multiplicative overlay mode a result is obtained that looks like the orientation information is staining the brightness. These results look often much nicer compared to gating-based display based on a brightness-gate, which is also supported.\r\nColor display of floating-point or 16 or higher bit data supports adaptively updating colormaps.\r\nZooming in on a colormap,  by changing the lower and upper display threshold, for some time the colormap is simply changed to yield a smooth experience but occasionally the cached display data is recomputed to avoid loosing fine granularity on the color levels.\r\n\r\n`View5D` also supports displaying and interacting with tracking in 3D over time (and other combinations) datasets.  This can come in handy for single particle or cell tracking. A particularly interesting feature is that the data can be pinned (aligned) to a chosen track. \r\n\r\n`View5D` has 3 context menus (main panel, element view panel and general) with large variety of ways to change the display. \r\n\r\n## Interaction with Julia\r\nThe interaction to Julia supports calling the viewer via one main method `view5d` supporting various options. Since the viewer is most useful for quick visualization and debugging, a multitude of short-hand convenience functions are provided:\r\n- `vv(data)`: starts a new viewer (window) and displays the data\r\n- `vp(data)`: starts a new viewer (window) and displays the data as complex values with a **color-phase** (multiplicative) overlay as a second channel. This is particularly useful for displaying complex-valued data. By default the `gamma ` correction for display is set to 0.3 enhancing the low-values. Naturally this can be prevented by the optional named argument `gamma` for all of the calls.\r\n- `ve(data)`: concatenates the data to display to the currently \"active\" viewer as a new entry along the element (==color) direction.\r\n- `vt(data)`: concatenates the data to display to the currently \"active\" viewer as a new entry along the time (slider on the right side) direction.\r\n- `vtp(data)`, `vep(data)`: concatenates color-phase display (see `vp`) along respective data directions.\r\n- `vr(data)`: replaces the currently displayed data in the currently \"active\" viewer by this new `data`.\r\n- `vrp(data)`: replaces color-phase display data in the currently \"active\" viewer by this new color-phase display `data`.\r\n\r\nAll of these function have corresponding macros (`@vv`, `@vp` etc.) to be used in analogy to the `@show` method. This eases debugging. If the preceding expression is a viewer reference, display is directed to this specific viewer. Here an example to update a specific viewer display every second in a for loop:\r\n```julia\r\nv= @vr rand(10,10,10,3); for n in 1:10  sleep(1); @vr v rand(10,10,10,3) end\r\n```\r\nImporting and exporting hierarchical sets of markers into and from the viewer are supported (`export_marker_lists`, `import_marker_lists`).\r\n\r\nView5D features a wide range of data formats: `Float32`, `Float64`, `UInt8`, `Int8`, `UInt16`, `Int16`, `UInt32`, `Int32`, `Int`, `Complex32`, `RGB` and `Gray`, also the outputs of the `Images.jl` `BioformatsLoader.jl` package. If context information such as axes sizes is available, it will shown accordingly in the viewer.\r\n\r\nDisplay of `Complex`-valued data can be toggled between `magnitude`, `phase`, `real` and `imaginary` part.  A complex-valued array by default switches the viewer to a `gamma` of 0.3 easing the inspection of Fourier-transformed data. However, gamma is adjustable interactively as well as when invoking the viewer.\r\n\r\nSince the viewer is written in Java and launched via JavaCall its thread should be pretty independent from julia. This should make the user experience pretty smooth also with minimal implications to julia threading performance. \r\n\r\nA current problems of `View5D` is that it is not well suited to displaying large datasets. This is due to memory usage and slow display due to on-the-fly calculations of features such as averages and the like.",

  "description": "**The Pluto notebook of this talk is available at https://talks.widmann.dev/2021/07/calibration/**\r\n\r\nThe talk focuses on:\r\n- introducing/explaining calibration of probabilistic models\r\n- discussing/showing how users can apply the offered evaluation measures and hypothesis tests\r\n- highlighting the relation to the Julia ecosystem, in particular to packages such as KernelFunctions and HypothesisTests and interfaces via pyjulia (Python) and JuliaCall (R)\r\n\r\nProbabilistic predictive models, including Bayesian and non-Bayesian models, output probability distributions of targets that try to capture uncertainty inherent in prediction tasks and modeling. In particular in safety-critical applications, it is important for decision-making that the model predictions actually represent these uncertainties in a reliable, meaningful, and interpretable way.\r\n\r\nA calibrated model provides such guarantees. Loosely speaking, if the same prediction would be obtained repeatedly, then it ensures that in the long run the empirical frequencies of observed outcomes are equal to this prediction. Note that usually it is not sufficient if a model is calibrated though: a constant model that always outputs the marginal distribution of targets, independently of the inputs, is calibrated but probably not very useful.\r\n\r\nCommonly, calibration is analyzed for classification models, often also in a reduced binary setting that focuses on the most-confident predictions only. Recently, we published a framework for calibration analysis of general probabilistic predictive models, including but not limited to classification and regression models. We implemented the proposed methods for calibration analysis in different Julia packages such that users can incorporate them easily in their evaluation pipeline.\r\n\r\n[CalibrationErrors.jl](https://github.com/devmotion/CalibrationErrors.jl) contains estimators of different calibration measures such as the expected calibration error (ECE) and the squared kernel calibration error (SKCE). The estimators of the SKCE are consistent, and both unbiased and unbiased estimators exist. The package uses kernels from KernelFunctions.jl, and hence many standard kernels are supported automatically.\r\n\r\n[CalibrationTests.jl](https://github.com/devmotion/CalibrationTests.jl) implements statistical hypothesis tests of calibration, so-called calibration tests. Most of these tests are based on the SKCE and can be applied to any probabilistic predictive model.\r\n\r\nFinally, the package [CalibrationErrorsDistributions.jl](https://github.com/devmotion/CalibrationErrorsDistributions.jl) extends calibration analysis to models that output probability distributions from Distributions.jl. Currently, Gaussian distributions, Laplace distributions, and mixture models are supported.\r\n\r\nTo increase the adoption of these calibration evaluation techniques by the statistics and machine learning communities, we also published interfaces to the Julia packages in [Python](https://github.com/devmotion/pycalibration) and [R](https://github.com/devmotion/rcalibration).\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\nWidmann, D., Lindsten, F., & Zachariah, D.

Various problems have been modeled such as:\r\n- sudoku\r\n- n-queens\r\n- magic square\r\n- chemical equilibrium\r\n- quadratic assignment\r\n- golomb ruler\r\n- minimum and maximum cuts in networks\r\n- traveler salesman problem\r\n- scheduling\r\n \r\nA store of instances, generators and global information combinatorial optimization problems is also available as *COPInstances.jl* (tentative name, WIP). This package aims for a larger audience than simply CP solvers, and we would be glad to see it grows for other optimization packages.\r\n \r\nFinally, JuliaConstraints hosts also some internal packages, mainly used within the *LocalSearchSolvers.jl* framework, but with the hope, that some parts can be shared with other solvers:\r\n- *Constraints.jl*: a store of usual constraints in CP\r\n- *ConstraintDomains.jl*: structures and methods for the domain of variables\r\n- *CompositionalNetworks.jl*: a glass-box neural networks for scalable compositions of functions\r\n- A very nice logo with chains and Julia (in)famous colored dots\r\n \r\nThere is an extensive list of incredible Julia packages and internal methods that provide all the computational power and the expressive syntax of the Constraint Programming ecosystem in Julia. We will also highlight the key external dependencies such as JuMP, Evolutionary, Dictionaries, Base.Threads, and more!\r\n \r\nIncidentally, we will try to have some fun with an interactive model session (if interactivity is allowed in the COVID-19 context) for LocalSearchSolvers.jl. Did we mention that the solving speed scale super linearly with the number of thread/process?",

  "description": "In our package DeconvOptim.jl we address deconvolution through an optimization problem.\r\nHowever, deconvolution is, due to the band limit of the PSF, an ill-conditioned inverse problem which cannot be solved directly.\r\nThe forward model is convolution of the PSF with our estimation. The PSF is the mathematical description of the optical system which introduces the blur.\r\nBased on an initial estimation we minimize an exchangeable loss function (for microscopy Poisson loss is widely used) with respect to a reconstruction being a consistent solution to the inverse problem. \r\nTo ensure certain constraints we allow that regularizers like Total Variation (TV) can be used. These regularizers are assembled before the optimization via metaprogramming and Tullio.jl.\r\nThe gradient of the full inverse problem pipeline is calculated by Zygote.jl and the optimization by Optim.jl (currently L-BFGS). Despite having microscopy images in mind the toolbox can be used for any type of signal deconvolution due to its flexibility. We also offer GPU/CUDA.jl support to a certain extend.\r\nThe full source code is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/roflmaostc/DeconvOptim.jl).",

  "description": "Constraint programming is used in a variety of fields ranging from simple puzzle solving to big instances in industry. Currently Julia does not have a package for constraint programming and JuMP itself is in the beginning of implementing constraints and variable sets to support constraint solvers in the future. ConstraintSolver.jl is a new Julia package to tackle the problem of solving constraint programming problems purely in Julia. This has advantages for prototyping new ideas which is harder to do in low level languages like C or C++. Additionally the solver will be able to solve problems with different types than just integers and floating point numbers i.e. an integration with Unitful.jl will be possible. Another advantage of a solver purely written in Julia is to easily use automatic differentiation.",

  "description": "Europe's increase in electricity production from renewable energy resources (RES) in combination with a significant decline of conventional generation capacity has spawned political and academic interest in the transmission system's ability to accommodate this transition. Central to this discussion is the efficiency of capacity allocation and congestion management (CACM) policies between and within electricity market areas that are interconnected by shared and synchronized transmission infrastructure. To facilitate unrestricted cross-border electricity trading in the presence of finite physical transmission capacity, European system and electricity market operator inaugurated flow-based market coupling (FBMC).\r\n\r\nFBMC is a coordinated multi-stage process that requires detailed forecasts and network models, which are typically not or only partially disclosed by the system operators. Academic publications that synthesize FBMC in model frameworks agree on a three step process – D-2 (base case), D-1 (day-ahead) and D-0 (redispatch) – but differ greatly in some core assumptions. Further, FBMC effectiveness for a future renewable-dominant generation mix is typically overlooked in the current literature. \r\n\r\nThe open-source Power Market Tool (POMATO) has been designed to study CACM policies of zonal electricity markets, especially flow-based market coupling (FBMC). For this purpose, POMATO implements methods for the analysis of simultaneous zonal market clearing, nodal (N-k secure) power flow computation for capacity allocation, and multi-stage market clearing with adaptive grid representation and redispatch. Additionally, POMATO includes risk-aware optimal power flow via chance constraints to internalize forecast uncertainty during the market clearing process. All optimization features rely on Julia/JuMP, leveraging its accessibility, computational performance, and solver interfaces. The Julia Code is embedded in a Python front-end, providing flexible and easily maintainable data processing and user interaction features.",

  "description": "Generating HTML + SVG output is a common requirement for applications, especially when building scientific dashboards. The faster the better. Being able to use proven hypertext fragments as templates is especially important. The ability to encapsulate and re-use these templates as functions is critical.\r\n\r\n`HypertextLiteral` (HTL) is a Julia package that satisfies these criteria, permitting complex hypertext output to be constructed server-side.  This package is inspired by its Javascript's namesake written by Mike Bostock, the creator of D3. It uses string literals along with list comprehension syntax. The `@htl` macro translates an HTML template into a function closure. Here is an example.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbooks = [\r\n (name=\"Who Gets What & Why\", year=2012, authors=[\"Alvin Roth\"]),\r\n (name=\"Switch\", year=2010, authors=[\"Chip Heath\", \"Dan Heath\"]),\r\n (name=\"Governing The Commons\", year=1990, authors=[\"Elinor Ostrom\"])]\r\n\r\nrender_row(book) = @htl(\"\"\"\r\n  <tr><td>$(book.name) ($(book.year))<td>$(join(book.authors, \" & \"))\r\n\"\"\")\r\n\r\nrender_table(books) = @htl(\"\"\"\r\n  <table><caption><h3>Selected Books</h3></caption>\r\n  <thead><tr><th>Book<th>Authors<tbody>\r\n  $((render_row(b) for b in books))</tbody></table>\"\"\")\r\n\r\ndisplay(\"text/html\", render_table(books))\r\n#=>\r\n<table><caption><h3>Selected Books</h3></caption>\r\n<thead><tr><th>Book<th>Authors<tbody>\r\n  <tr><td>Who Gets What &amp; Why (2012)<td>Alvin Roth\r\n  <tr><td>Switch (2010)<td>Chip Heath &amp; Dan Heath\r\n  <tr><td>Governing The Commons (1990)<td>Elinor Ostrom\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n=#\r\n```\r\n\r\n*HTL is contextual.* At macro expansion time, the string template is passed through a light-weight HTML/SGML lexer. This is used to track the context of each interpolated Julia expression: is it part of element content, an attribute value, or is it inside an element tag where several attributes might be expanded? There is also a rawtext context used when content is inside a `script` tag.\r\n\r\n*HTL is extensible.* With multiple dispatch, custom data types can provide their own contextual serialization. This permits us to omit boolean attributes that are false. It also lets us expand vectors differently dependent upon context: within element content, they are simply appended; while within attribute values, they are space separated.\r\n\r\n*HTL is fast.*  A template rendering that takes 500μs with HTL, takes 4.5ms with naive string interpolation and list comprehension. Object based alternatives, such as Hyperscript, take even longer (21ms). Memory usage of HTL is likewise low. It uses 1/3rd less memory than naive string approach, and 1/6th the memory of an object based approach.\r\n\r\nThis efficiency was achieved by emulating Julia's documentation system.  Each component of the template is converted into an object which prints its content to a given `IO`. During macro processing, we build a Julia program that relies upon three primitive structures:\r\n\r\n- *Bypass* is used for content that should be emitted as-is.\r\n- *Render* is used for content that should be properly escaped.\r\n- *Reprint* is a function closure used for composing content.\r\n\r\nAs the template is converted, leaf nodes are converted into either *Render* or *Bypass*, depending if they are part of the template, or part of variables that are to be escaped.  *Reprint* is used to concatenate adjacent components that appear in the template or are generated by a list comprehension.\r\n\r\n*HTL is safe.*  Escaping code is layered using an `IO` proxy. Each of the 3 primitives has their own dispatch with regard to this proxy. This way, so long as the template translation properly distinguishes between `Bypass` and `Render` chunks,  escaping is always performed. Handled as an exception, `<script>` content is checked to ensure it does not contain the `\"</script>\"` literal but is otherwise unescaped.\r\n\r\nHTL can serialize attribute sets from pairs, dictionaries or named tuples. Unlike its Javascript namesake, we don't get clever with `camelCase` attribute names, which must be left as-is for SVG. Instead, we only convert `snake_case` names to their `kebab-case` equivalent. Moreover, if attribute sets are constants, we can pre-compute their serialization at macro expansion time.\r\n\r\nIt is notable how nicely the Julia implementation flowed together.  Julia's excellent macro facility lets us easily convert embedded functions and list comprehensions into relevant template logic. Julia's handling of tiny function closures was outstanding: not only does it let us write code that is easy to read, the approach turned out to be surprisingly fast.  Julia's `IO` interface lets us easily insert a proxy that was trivial to write, and, yet again, surprisingly efficient. Finally, multiple dispatch enables user-defined types to have their own serialization. Kudos Julia.\r\n\r\nThis approach could be used to make similar template libraries for other structured notations, such as JSON.",

  "description": "MadNLP leverages diverse sparse and dense linear algebra routines: UMFPACK, HSL routines, MUMPS, Pardiso, LAPACK, and cuSOLVER. The key feature of MadNLP is the adoption of scalable linear algebra methods: structure-exploiting parallel linear algebra (based on restricted additive Schwarz and Schur complement strategy) and GPU-based linear algebra (cuSOLVER). These methods significantly enhance the scalability of the solver to large-scale problem instances (e.g., long-horizon dynamic optimization, stochastic programs, abd dense NLPs). Furthermore, MadNLP exploits Julia's extensibility so that new linear solvers can be added in a plug-and-play manner. In the presentation, we will present benchmark results against other open-source and commercial solvers as well as the results highlighting MadNLP's advanced features. Our results suggest that (i) MadNLP has comparable speed and robustness with Ipopt/KNITRO when tested against the standard benchmark test set (CUTEst); (ii) MadNLP with structure-exploiting parallel linear algebra can achieve speed-up up of a factor of 3 when solving large-scale sparse nonlinear programs; and (iii) GPU-acceleration achieves the speed-up of a factor of 10 when solving dense nonlinear optimization problems. The presentation will conclude with a future development roadmap, including the implementation of distributed-memory parallelism and pure-GPU solver.",

  "description": "This workshop accommodates data-scientists and statisticians that have experience with a language like R, but have not used Julia previously. In learning to use Julia, a contemporary \"stats based\" approach is taken focusing on short scripts that achieve concrete goals. The primary focus is on statistical applications and packages. The Julia language is covered as a by-product of the applications. Thus, this workshop is much more of a *how to use Julia for stats* course than a *how to program in Julia* course. This approach may be suitable for statisticians and data-scientists that tend to do their day-to-day scripting with a data and model based approach - as opposed to a software development approach. \r\n\r\nThe topics covered include:\r\n\r\n* Basic probability and Monte Carlo.\r\n* Basics from the in-built Statistics package and the [StatsBase](https://juliastats.org/StatsBase.jl/stable/) package.\r\n* Basic plotting and statistical plotting with [StatsPlots](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/StatsPlots.jl).\r\n* Using the [Distributions](https://juliastats.org/Distributions.jl/latest/) package.\r\n* (Basic) usage of the [Dataframes](https://dataframes.juliadata.org/stable/) package.\r\n* Using the [GLM](https://juliastats.org/GLM.jl/stable/) package.\r\n* Other useful resources and packages.\r\n\r\n(Note that Julia has hundreds of statistical packages and we can not cover them all in 3 hours).\r\n\r\nCode snippets from [Statistics with Julia: Fundamentals for Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence](https://statisticswithjulia.org/) will be used in conjunction with smaller live constructed examples.\r\n\r\nAn extensive Jupyter notebook for the workshop together with data files is [here](https://github.com/yoninazarathy/JuliaCon2021-StatisticsWithJuliaFromTheGroundUp). You can install it to follow along.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have Julia with IJulia (Jupyter) installed, you can follow the instructions in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJleqSITuRo).",

  "description": "ERPs are backbone systems to any living organization, whether small, medium, or large. Almost every organization use ERP concepts, whether in a piece of paper, excel file, MS Access DB or large sophisticated systems like SAP, Oracle data warehouse & databases. \r\n\r\nOrganizations deal with many ERP modules like Buy to Pay, Order to Cash and GL to manage Finance, Supply chain operations daily.\r\n\r\nERP systems aren’t luxury apps anymore, Often Small businesses see GL (or perhaps entire ERP system), intended only for Big organizations. However, even Big Org operate in small units and merge later into a Corporate Ledger. \r\n\r\nHaving a system to read, write and understand your financials books brings extraordinary benefits to any size of business.\r\n\r\nRecent popularity of software like Quick-books, NetSuite, Tally are proof that ERP are the way to manage business successfully. People use piece of papers, notebooks, excels, word documents in their daily life to manage expenses, record Actuals, plan future Budgets and even forecast future savings to some extent.\r\n\r\nMedium, Big Org just happen to use sophisticated ERP systems like SAP, Oracle, PeopleSoft, Coupa etc. but conceptually, they don’t do anything different other than following simple ERP concepts daily to manage critical business operations, record Actual and forecast earnings.\r\n\r\nProblem Statement: IT industry & Giant Market leaders created extraordinary ERP systems to record transactions. Even a small merchant, now uses his mobile to take picture of invoice and pays vendor online. Medium organizations can auto-correct invoices and process vouchers, and Big Org’s ERPs can count live inventory across regions. These systems provide a unified platform for all small, medium and large entities to record i.e. write their data in structured or unstructured forms into their secured on-premise or cloud locations.\r\n\r\nRead, Write and Understand are 3 different aspects of ERP data, while these ERP systems achieved perfection in “write”, there is a lot more to do in “read and understand data”.\r\n\r\nThis Julia Language GeneralLedger.jl is built to serve this purpose only.\r\n\r\nThis package will provide a complete Analytic Software environment, which can be deployed as a bolt-on or independent app for all data extract, load, transformation, ad-hoc reporting & analytics, visualizations and tooling to support Data Science using AI, ML predictive Analytics.\r\n\r\nWhy Julia Language:- because it take a village to create Analytics platform, Julia is not solving 2 language problem here in ERP space, ERP systems already have 4, 5 or 6 language problems.\r\nTransactions systems are not primarily used for Reporting/analytics purpose, imagine using Walmart pay register to run data analytics.\r\n\r\nOrganizations spend millions of $$s to move their data to appropriate data platform, they use ELT, ETL, create Data warehouses, Data lakes to keep this data in sync.\r\n\r\nERP systems run complex data operations to clean this data set before it’s made available to business users, supply chain managers and executive leaders in form of analytics tools like Cognos Data marts, Tableau, Power BI, Oracle OACs, Kibana or Google Analytics like business intelligence tools.\r\nWhile these tools are great for operational reporting, they lack analytics. \r\n\r\nI am not talking about simple data operations like removing duplicates, drill down, drill through reporting or creating bar- graphs, drawing moving average lines on simple graphs.\r\n\r\nBy Data Science, I mean, plotting entire company General Ledger data on a single graph. I am talking about using Network science/ graph theory to manage supply chain, using Machine Learning prediction for Real time inventory use charts.\r\n\r\nJulia solves this problem, it’s one Data Science language, which can be used for data loading, cleansing, transformations, visualizations and then running advance AI, ML or Deep learning computational operations on huge data sets.\r\n\r\nReal time, real life statistics:- “Walk Like Python; Run Like C” is enough to pick this language for all my daily work.  ERP leaders have a business to run, and a community to serve.\r\n\r\n“Julia is high performance”, made for Asynchronous, parallel, distributed GPU computing,\r\n\r\nJulia language provides fast computations for large data sets and great assets for Statistical programming, makes Julia Language is THE language for ERP Analytics.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, I will share my Julia notebooks for General Ledger. I will share, how Julia provide data structure for LEDGER, FINANCE using sophisticated TYPE system. How data can be quickly transformed to Fact/Dimension star schema for self-service and real-time reporting. and I will share some of my Julia notebooks I used to perform Time Series, Deep Learning and Graph analysis on Finance data.",

  "description": "A districting plan is a partitioning of a geographical region, such as a city or a state, into connected pieces with approximately equal population. U.S. law requires that states redraw their districts every ten years, and district lines have a significant effect on voter representation. Gerrymandering is the practice of drawing districts that increase the power of one group of voters at the expense of others, typically along partisan or racial lines. Recently, a community of mathematicians, computer scientists, and policy experts have developed a suite of techniques for drawing districting plans and detecting gerrymandering. Ensemble analysis—the sampling of many reasonable districting plans from a distribution, with the goal of establishing the range of typical outcomes—is an increasingly popular method in this domain that has recently been used effectively by expert witnesses in high-profile voting rights lawsuits. In these analyses, a districting plan is represented as a weight-balanced _k_-partitioning of the dual graph of geographic units; these units might be counties, voting precincts, or U.S. Census blocks, depending on the granularity of the analysis.\r\n\r\nTo sample from a _known_ distribution of districting plans, it is useful to employ a Markov chain. Our research group maintains the popular Python package GerryChain (github.com/mggg/GerryChain), which implements a variety of Markov chains for redistricting and has been used in court cases and published academic research. However, this package’s performance is severely limited for many types of chains, such as the recombination (ReCom) chain developed by DeFord et al. Recombination chains are attractive because they sample from a diverse set of reasonable plans by merging two contiguous districts at a time, drawing a random spanning tree, and cutting the tree into population-balanced halves. GerryChain.jl improves on the performance of the recombination chains implemented in the original GerryChain package by over an order of magnitude in a single-core setting, and the powerful worker pool-based parallelization features in Distributed.jl yield an additional 5x speedup. Through our continuing work on GerryChain.jl, we hope to advance the state of Julia’s geospatial packages and popularize Julia in the computational public policy community. Our work is available at github.com/mggg/GerryChainJulia.",

  "description": "The stable assignment problem, introduced in the 1960s by David Gale and Lloyd Shapley, has recently elicited new interest due to its applications in public school assignment and a new, nonatomic framing that relates stable school assignments to market-clearing cutoff vectors. I introduce DeferredAcceptance, a Julia package for solving and analyzing school-choice problems. It provides several variations of the discrete Gale-Shapley and top-trading cycles algorithms, as well as a trio of memory-efficient algorithms for computing an equilibrium in nonatomic admissions markets. In the discrete case, while there are some open-source tools available for running the basic form of the Gale-Shapley algorithm, DeferredAcceptance enables seamless comparison of a variety of assignment procedures for given market data. In the nonatomic case, DeferredAcceptance provides school-demand functions based on the multinomial logit choice model and a variety of scoring schemes; it also permits a user-defined demand function, enabling simulation of a wide range of competitive scenarios.",

  "description": "In 1929, the influential physicist Paul Dirac stated ``The underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty is only that the exact application of these laws leads to equations much too complicated to be soluble\". Nearly a century later, theoretical and computational chemists have developed a multitude of sophisticated methods to model the electronic structure of atoms and molecules. Paired with the advances in computational power, approximate solutions to the electronic Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation for many electron systems ($\\hat{H}\\Psi = E\\Psi$) are employed by scientists to solve important problems in chemistry, physics, biology and materials science. Implementation of these quantum chemistry methods are available in well known packages such as Psi4, Cfour, NWChem, and MRCC to name a few. Approximating molecular wave functions involves heavy numerical effort; therefore, codes are written completely or partially in efficient languages such as C, C++, and Fortran. While the contribution of these codes are invaluable to the field, the development of new methods is often hindered by the learning curve of the programming languages that they are built upon.\r\n\r\nIn order to accelerate the production of new implementations and ameliorate the maintenance of the code base, packages such as Psi4 and PySCF are written, as much as possible, in Python. This facilitates collaboration of computational chemists towards producing new programs and update existing ones. The emergence of Julia as a powerful tool in scientific computing motivated our development of the Fermi.jl package for quantum chemistry computations. Fermi.jl is written completely in Julia, with only external interfaces to resources written in other languages, such as libcint, a C library for molecular integrals evaluation. Currently, Fermi.jl can handle energy computations for a few important \\textit{ab initio} methods: Restricted Hartree--Fock (RHF), M\\o{}ller--Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) and Coupled Cluster theory up to perturbative triples [CCD, CCSD, and CCSD(T)]. The code design is based on readability, simplicity and extensibility, utilizing dynamic multiple dispatch for an elegant control flow. For example, MP2 computations can be done with single or double precision and with or without density fitting approximation for integrals. The main body of the code is the same for all combinations, with specific dispatches being called depending on the data type of the molecular integrals. The coupled cluster module leverages the capabilities of the TensorOperations.jl library, in particular allowing for automatic factorization of the tensor contractions. Each line of the code expresses a contraction that can be mapped to the corresponding mathematical term from the theory (often represented as diagrams). Unlike most electronic structure packages, Fermi.jl does not have an input file structure. It can be used interactively or one can write simple Julia scripts, both cases are facilitated by macros offering shortcuts for settings and routine calls. As Fermi.jl is improved and expanded, we hope to motivate computational chemists to consider Julia as modern alternative to traditional computing in electronic structure modeling.",

  "description": "In this talk, we will discuss how the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) uses Julia for forecasting. We will focus on how the FRBNY adjusted its dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model for the rapid changes in economic conditions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. These changes, which are available publicly through DSGE.jl, include the ability to solve and estimate an economic model with multiple regimes (where regimes differ in the equations that describe the economy). Regime-switching allows the FRBNY DSGE to better capture the economic effects of COVID-19 as well as the switch to the new interest rate policy of average inflation targeting (AIT) announced by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in August 2020. In modeling the impact of this policy change it is assumed that the introduction of the new reaction function is only partially incorporated by the agents in forming expectations. Specifically, these are formed using a convex combination of forecasts obtained under the old and the new policy reaction functions. We write the code generically, so other forms of exogenous regime-switching and imperfect credibility about policy rules are accommodated.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we will demonstrate how this new model is estimated. New features in DSGE.jl, SMC.jl, and ModelConstructors.jl provide a user-friendly API for estimating parameters that change over time. We then show how to estimate this new model in an “online” manner that uses estimation results from an older model trained on data until before the pandemic. This method speeds up estimation times and can be applied even when the model has new COVID-specific parameters.\r\n\r\nThroughout the talk, we will discuss how Julia’s functionalities and runtime performance enabled us to implement and use these changes quickly, which was crucial in forecasting during the rapidly-changing economic conditions over the last year.\r\n\r\nThese advances in DSGE.jl will be useful to any Julia users who are interested in flexibly modeling the economy, particularly in crisis situations as during the recession in 2020. It will also be useful to anyone who regularly conducts Bayesian estimation and is interested in re-using the results from an old estimation to efficiently estimate a new model or with new data.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: This talk reflects the experience of the authors and does not represent an endorsement by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System of any particular product or service.

  "description": "Regression is a foundational technique of statistical analysis, and many common statistical tests are based on regression models (e.g., ANOVA, t-test, correlation tests, etc.).\r\nDespite the expressive power of regression models, users often prefer the simpler procedures because regression models themselves can be difficult to interpret.\r\nMost notably, the interpretation of individual regression coefficients (including their magnitude, sign, and even significance) changes depending on the presence or even centering/contrast coding of other terms or interactions.\r\nFor instance, a common source of confusion in regression analysis is the meaning of the intercept coefficient.\r\nOn its own, this coefficient corresponds to the grand mean of the independent variable, but in the presence of a contrast-coded categorical variable, it can correspond to the mean of the baseline level of that variable, the grand mean, or something else altogether, depending on the contrast coding scheme that is used.\r\nEffects.jl provides a general-purpose tool for interpreting fitted regression models by projecting the effects of one or more terms in the model back into \"data space\", along with the associated uncertainty, fixing other the value of other terms at typical or user-specified values.\r\nThis makes it straightforward to interrogate the estimated effects of any predictor at any combination of other predictors' values.\r\nBecause these effects are computed in data space, they can be plotted in parallel format to raw or aggregated data, enabling intuitive model interpretation and sanity checks.",

  "description": "The *JuliaConstraints* GitHub organization was born last fall and aims to improve collaborative packages around the theme of Constraint Programming (CP) in Julia. \r\nAs for many fields of optimization, there is often a trade-off between efficiency and the simplicity of the model. **CompositionalNetworks.jl** was designed to smooth that trade-off. One could make a parallel with not having to choose between the speed of C and the simplicity of Python (among others).\r\nAn Interpretable Compositional Networks (ICN) takes any vector (of arbitrary size) as an input and outputs a (non-negative) value that corresponds to a user given metric. For instance, consider an error function network in Constraint Programming, one can choose a Hamming distance metric to evaluate the distance between a configuration of the variables’ values and the closest satisfying values. It provides the minimum number of variables to change to reach a solution. \r\nA usual constraint showing the modeling power of Constraint Programming is the `AllDifferent` constraint which ensures that all the variables take different values. One can model a Sudoku problem with only such constraints. \r\nAn ICN, in its most basic form, is composed of four layers: transformation, arithmetic, aggregation, and composition layers. Weights between the layers are binary, meaning that neurons (operations) are either connected to, or disconnected from each other neuron in adjacent layers. These simple boolean weights allow a straightforward composition of the operations composing an ICN, and provide a result that is interpretable by a human. The user can then, either verify and use the composition directly, or use it as an inspiration for a handmade composition.\r\nAn ICN learning on a small space of 4 variables with domain [1, 2, 3, 4] can extract the following function: \r\n```\r\nicn_all_different(x::AbstractVector) = x |> count_eq_left |> count_positive |> identity\r\n```\r\nwhere `count_eq_left` is the function that counts the number of elements of `x` smaller than `xi` for each `i`, and `count_positive` counts the number of elements `xi>0`. This output is equivalent to the best known handmade error function for the `AllDifferent` constraint. Furthermore, it is fully scalable to any vector length.\r\n \r\nIn CompositionalNetworks.jl, we generate the code of the composed function directly. We can even compile it on the fly due to the meta programming capabilities of Julia. Moreover, we can also export the compositions to human-readable language or other programming languages. \r\nUsers can check and modify the function composed by an ICN to adapt or improve the output to its needs and requirements. Of course, the function can also be used directly.\r\n \r\nDuring this talk, we will cover an out-of-the-box use of CompositionalNetworks.jl along with the different julian and non-julian key aspects to the development of this package. Among others, the use of other julian packages as dependencies such as  the genetic algorithm in Evolutionary.jl to fix the Boolean weights of an ICN, or the generation of compositions in either programming code or mathematical language through Julia efficient meta programming.\r\nThe versatility of the Julia version of ICN mixed with metaprogramming allows a much broader practical use cases for any user of ICN compared to the original C++ version, where modifying the code is a much harder task, and metaprogramming is not possible (and usually not recommended for (pre)compiled languages)\r\n \r\nWhile we provide a basic ICN use-case as error function networks in Constraint Programming, it is straightforward for the user to provide additional operations, or even layers. The type of functions learned and composed is more versatile than our use case. We hope this package can have some use for, but not limited to, the people in the Constraint Programming and the Julia communities.\r\n \r\nAlthough our current applications are mainly within some packages of *JuliaConstraints*, we hope to exchange with the community for other methods to compose functions, apply them to other problems, and improve our understanding of Julia for Interpretable Compositional Networks.",

There I had a chance to first touch\r\ndataflow programming, Common Lisp, and actor model of programming. \r\n\r\nThis century I have been working at a geographic software company (ownership of it went through acquisitions, spin-offs,\r\nand such, so one very long employment looks like several shorter ones from a formal viewpoint), \r\nwhile doing research in parallel. My research focus was mostly on theoretical neuroscience for a while,\r\nthen a research collaboration on deep connections between _partial metrics_ and _fuzzy equalities_, \r\nand finally (from approximately Fall of 2012) a research collaboration\r\non deep connections between _partial contradictions_ and _vector semantics of programming languages_ \r\nand, from 2014-2015 on, a series of research collaborations on _neuromophic computations with linear streams_. \r\n\r\nStarting from about 2011 I was gradually moving from just being a lover of computer animation and electronic music to\r\nmy first attempts to make some visual, audio, and audio-visual art of my own, and I am continuing to make new computer art every few months or so.\r\nIt involved playing a bit with MilkDrop 2 for WinAmp, mixing music a bit with Serato DJ,\r\ndoing a lot of animations and a bit of sound work in Processing, doing a tiny bit of that in Clojure,\r\nand finally working a bit with shader-based GLSL animations.\r\n\r\n### 2015-present\r\n\r\n_Linear streams_ are streams for which linear combinations of several streams are defined. If one makes sure that\r\nlinear computations and general (often non-linear) computations are interleaved, then one gets continuously deformable programs which\r\nwe call **Dataflow matrix machines (DMMs)**. Another way to obtain DMMs is to start with recurrent neural networks\r\nand replace streams of numbers with linear streams and allow complicated \"activation functions\"\r\n(that is, transformations of linear streams) with arbitrary arity.\r\n\r\nThis setup also allows these neural machines to have very natural and flexible self-modification facilities.\r\nThere are toy implementations in Processing with mutable matrices, and the reference implementation in Clojure with\r\nimmutable streams of tree-shaped \"flexible-rank tensors\". The reference paper on DMMs is https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07447\r\n\r\nI hope to create the next application of this formalism in Julia \r\n(both **Julia Flux** and **JAX** are the machine learning frameworks which finally have sufficient flexibility\r\nwe need to take full advantage of the flexibility of DMMs). I started to switch to Julia in the early 2020.\r\nI recently sketched a three-page note outlining my hopes in this sense: https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~bukatin/towards-practical-dmms.pdf"

  "description": "It would be great to understand the properties of matrix multiplication better. This seems to be particularly worthwhile because matrix multiplication plays a prominent role in Transformers, a class of machine learning models invented in 2017 and responsible for many recent breakthroughs including GPT-3. Sometimes, the rows of the left-hand-side matrix are softmax-normalized in order to use them as probabilities.\r\n\r\nOne can interpret a monochrome image as a matrix (the size of the matrix depends on the resolution of the image in question, so one should rescale the image in question as desired). I decided to explore whether matrix products of monochrome images are visually interesting. I used JuliaImages packages, Julia LinearAlgebra facilities and Julia Jupyter notebooks.\r\n\r\nI looked at standard Julia test images, such as \"mandrill\" and \"jetplane\", and discovered that there is plenty of visually interesting information in their matrix products. I used the scaling of pixel values which is also used by ImageView.imshow() methods.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that the matrix products were particularly informative and had a lot of visible fine structure, if one softmax-normalized rows of the left-hand-side matrix and columns of the right-hand-side matrix before taking the product. The images looked slightly toned-down and striped after normalization, but not too different visually. However the products were drastically different. Note that in Transformer models one usually applies softmax only on one side, but this turns out to be insufficient for our visual exploration of matrix products.\r\n\r\nI like the resulting images as visual art, and I think this might point to some interesting novel ways to obtain visual art by mathematical transformations.\r\n\r\nI also hope this might eventually be of help as people try to achieve better understanding and more fine-grained control of our machine learning models.\r\n\r\nThe markdown file commenting the Julia notebook and elaborating on machine learning connections is posted at https://github.com/anhinga/julia-notebooks/blob/main/images-as-matrices/presentation/commentary.md\r\n\r\nAfter this proposal was submitted, I have explored composing matrix multiplications with other image transformations. The resulting compact neural machines produce visually interesting results.\r\n\r\nI have conducted first experiments in solving machine learning problems formulated in terms of those compact machines taking advantage of flexibility of differentiable programming in Julia Flux.\r\n\r\nI have created a repository containing materials relevant to this poster: https://github.com/anhinga/JuliaCon2021-poster",

  "description": "In modern (SQL) database query engines, there are two major approaches on how to evaluate user-provided queries in a highly performant manner (see e.g. [1]):\r\n\r\nQuery Compilation: Each pipeline of a query plan gets compiled into a single function that effectively fuses operators into a single (nested) for-loop. This function is then compiled to highly-optimized machine code. Operators process data tuple-at-a-time.\r\n\r\nVectorization: The query plan is interpreted, and each operator in the plan is mapped to a pre-compiled function. To offset the arising interpretation cost, each operator evaluates batches (\"vectors\") of, say, 1000 values in bulk on each step.\r\n\r\nQuery compilation offers more optimization potential for LLVM and is often effective at keeping values in registers, while vectorization enables shorter compilation times — for better support of interactive queries. As part of the production-grade RelationalAI Knowledge Graph Management System, we implemented both approaches in Julia.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we explain in greater detail how both of these fundamentally different techniques work, why we are implementing them, and how we aim to combine them. We showcase where Julia enabled us to implement highly performant code with ease, but also reveal where we had to spend non-trivial amounts of engineering effort to arrive at the desired performance.\r\n\r\n[1] https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p2209-kersten.pdf",

  "description": "Pervasive and performant multiple dispatch in Julia has led to the development of functions that convey generic meaning. Deciding on a name and settling on the meaning of these generic functions is challenging work, but it is essential for generic programming.\r\n\r\nFunctions can be used to direct dispatch. e.g.\r\n\r\n```julia\r\nreduce(vcat, [[1,2,3], [4,5], [6,7,8,9]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is a fallback method of `reduce` that works for any binary operation, not just `vcat`. However, there is also a method specific to `vcat` that preallocates the result. Both the fallback and the specialization produce the same result, but the specialization is likely to perform better since it is inexpensive to calculate the size of the result.\r\n\r\nConsider e.g. `Base.filter` and `Base.Iterators.filter`. The second simply constructs a `Base.Iterators.Filter`, which is in essence nothing more than a lazy representation of `Base.filter(f, itr)`. We developed an experimental package [`FixArgs.jl`](https://github.com/goretkin/FixArgs.jl) to represent this:\r\n\r\n```julia\r\njulia> @xquote filter(iseven, $(1:5))\r\nCall(Some(filter), FrankenTuple((Some(iseven), Some(1:5)), NamedTuple()))\r\n```\r\n\r\nSuppose we want to define `eltype`, the same way it is defined for `Base.Iterators.Filter`. We can define an `eltype` method for `Call` for the specific parameter `filter`. `FixArgs.jl` defines a macro to help (but the ergonomics should still be improved):\r\n\r\n```julia\r\njulia> Base.eltype(filt::(@xquoteT filter(::F, ::I))) where {F, I} = eltype(something(filt.args[2]))\r\n\r\njulia> eltype(@xquote filter(iseven, $(1:5)))\r\nInt64\r\n```\r\n\r\n`FixArgs.jl` began as a generalization of `Base.Fix1` and `Base.Fix2`, but identifies a common pattern that could systematically replace many existing types and methods. e.g. Broadcasting relies on types to represent lazy function calls, and `materialize` to perform the computation (with e.g. dot fusion). `Base.Generator` and `collect` are analogous.\r\n\r\nInstead of generating a new name for a type, and attaching meaning to it, one can meaningfully compose a name from existing meaningful names. One straightforward example is to define `Rational{T}` as\r\n\r\n```julia\r\njulia> (@xquoteT ::T / ::T) where T\r\nFixArgs.Call{Some{typeof(/)}, FrankenTuples.FrankenTuple{Tuple{Some{T}, Some{T}}, (), Tuple{}}} where T\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `Rational{Int}` and (@xquoteT ::Int / ::Int) have identical memory layouts!\r\n(Also, occasionally, there is a need for a `Rational`-like type that does not constrain the numerator and denominator to have the same type. The type above would fit the bill).\r\n\r\nIn this case, `Rational` is in Base, but more generally packages have to depend on a common package (usually called `*Base.jl`) that defines types. If it is possible to define new types terms of existing types, then in a sense the types are structural and not nominal. This may reduces the need for these common packages and enable better package interoperability.\r\n\r\nAs another example, the type `Base.Generator(f, itr)` could be identical to `@xquote map(f, itr)` (though not exactly since the meaning of `map` and `collect` are currently conflated (https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/39628)\r\n\r\nThere are many other examples in the ecosystem, such as in `LazySets.jl`, `LazyArrays.jl`, `MappedArrays.jl`, `StructArrays.jl`, ... where types are defined to essentially represent lazy function calls ad-hoc. They each have a version of \"materialize\". Note that in most cases, these cannot be replaced directly since `Call` cannot e.g. subtype `AbstractArray` and `AbstractSet`.\r\n\r\n`Base.Fix1`, etc. is useful, even though one can already define a lambda function with the same behavior, because it is possible to dispatch on the structure of this lambda function as opposed to having an opaque name:\r\n\r\n```julia\r\njulia> x -> x > 2\r\n#3 (generic function with 1 method)\r\n\r\njulia> >(2)\r\n(::Base.Fix2{typeof(>),Int64}) (generic function with 1 method)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`FixArgs.jl` (which really should be called e.g. `StructuralLambdas.jl`) allows one to easily define these structural lambdas:\r\n\r\n```julia\r\njulia> @xquote x -> x > 2\r\nFix2(>,2)\r\n\r\njulia> typeof(@xquote x -> x > 2)\r\nFix2{typeof(>), Int64} (alias for FixArgs.Lambda{FixArgs.Arity{1, Nothing}, FixArgs.Call{Some{typeof(>)}, FrankenTuples.FrankenTuple{Tuple{FixArgs.ArgPos{1}, Some{Int64}}, (), Tuple{}}}})\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Better aesthetics would be necessary for usability.)\r\n\r\nSee https://goretkin.github.io/FixArgs.jl/dev/ for more motivation and details, including examples for replacing `Complex` and generalizing `FixedPointNumbers.jl`.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this talk is about an idea, not `FixArgs.jl` itself. It may turn out that the idea is not practical; e.g. it might pose immense challenges for compilation, or it might be too confusing to marry the meaning of functions and `Call`, or package interoperability will fail due to subtle differences. I hope the idea holds promise. A great way to find out is at JuliaCon 2021.",

  "description": "Decision rules offer a rich and tractable framework for solving certain classes of multistage adaptive optimization problems. Recent literature has shown the promise of using linear and nonlinear decision rules in which wait-and-see decisions are represented as functions, whose parameters are decision variables to be optimized, of the underlying uncertain parameters.  Despite this growing success, solving real-world stochastic optimization problems can become computationally prohibitive when using nonlinear decision rules, and in some cases, linear ones. Consequently, decision rules that offer a competitive trade-off between solution quality and computational time become more attractive. Whereas the extant research has always used homogeneous (i.e., either linear or piecewise-linear) decision rules, the major contribution of this paper is a computational exploration of hybrid decision rules combining the benefits of the two classes of decision rules. We also demonstrate a case where, unexpectedly, a linear decision rule is superior to a more complex piecewise-linear decision rule within a simulator. This observation bolsters the need to assess the quality of decision rules obtained from a look-ahead model within a simulator rather than just using the optimal look-ahead objective function value.",

  "description": "I used to do pictorial block programming in languages like Scratch. But these pictorial blocks were quite basic, and though they could enable me to do quite a lot, I preferred to try to make my own things, some of which were beyond the blocks given in Scratch.   \r\n\r\nProgramming in Julia was great fun and made me perceive things from a coding point of view. I also used the Math I had learned from school to program simple things like a calculator, and I started thinking about how I could use Julia to change or improve some aspects of human life or just make things easier. I’m very fond of music and had been taught both the Western notation and the Indian Classical ones. However, my mother was having trouble deciphering the western notes, since she had been only trained in Indian Classical Music. \r\n\r\nThen the idea hit me. What if I could use Julia to create a Musical Note converter? If I entered the notes of a song, it could translate it into western or Indian Classical Music, according to the user’s need. I then made a simple if-loop program which converts a single note. Now, I plan to work on this idea further. It will be a bit of a challenge but I’m excited to do it. To conclude, there are limitless possibilities of things I want to do and create in Julia, and it’s really quite interesting to learn. I know this idea seems quite simple, and will be in front of all the other Julia Con submissions. But I’d really love to come ahead and share my experience on Julia Con. \r\n\r\nI would love to talk about Julia and my wonderful experience so far. I also hope I’ll have many more in the future.",

  "description": "Some people like to almost endlessly tinker with their plots and the LaTeX plot package PGFPlots is one of the plotting packages that allow for such tinkering. It comes with a 600-page manual describing an almost endless number of dials and levers that can be turned and pulled to finally get the perfect plot. One of its drawbacks is that coding in LaTeX can be argued to be quite unpleasant. The error messages are often not good and there is very little linting support. `PGFPlots.jl` is a Julia package that brings all the good things about PGFPlots into Julia while remedying the bad part by allowing one to use Julia for the coding part.\r\n\r\nOne of the big design goals of the package was to facilitate \"translatability\" of LaTeX PGFPlots code into Julia over, for example, terseness. This was based on the observation that many plots are created by \"stitching together\" parts of different examples that can be found scattered over the internet. Allowing LaTeX PGFPlots code to easily be brought into Julia would open up a big amount of example code to be used.  It also means that the official PGFPlots manual largely acts as a manual for the package.\r\n\r\nEven though the API is made to resemble the one in LaTeX it is of a much higher level than the LaTeX counterpart. Many Julia objects can be directly used as inputs to the plot and will \"convert\" in a predictable way. Some examples of plottable Julia objects include data frames (from `DataFrames.jl)`, contours (from `Contours.jl`), colors (from `Colors.jl`), error bars (from `Measurements.jl`).\r\n\r\nFor people that desire a terser coding style while still having easy access to the PGFPlots renderer, it is possible to use `PGFPlotsX.jl` as a backend to `Plots.jl`. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will discuss how the design goals outlined above were achieved and give some illustrative examples and use cases. Attendees should get an overview of the package and be able to determine if using the package for their daily plotting is suitable.",

The physical processes governing natural systems' evolution are often mathematically described as systems of differential equations. Fast and accurate solutions require numerical implementations to leverage modern parallel hardware.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this workshop is to offer an interactive hands-on to solve systems of differential equations in parallel on GPUs using the [`ParallelStencil.jl`](https://github.com/omlins/ParallelStencil.jl) and [`ImplicitGlobalGrid.jl`](https://github.com/eth-cscs/ImplicitGlobalGrid.jl) Julia modules. [`ParallelStencil.jl`](https://github.com/omlins/ParallelStencil.jl) permits to write architecture-agnostic parallel high-performance GPU and CPU code and [`ImplicitGlobalGrid.jl`](https://github.com/eth-cscs/ImplicitGlobalGrid.jl) renders stencil-based distributed parallelisation almost trivial. The resulting codes are fast, short and readable. We will use these two Julia modules to design and implement a (multi-) GPU application that predicts ice flow dynamics over mountainous topography.\r\n\r\nThe workshop consists of 2 parts:\r\n1. You will learn about parallel and distributed computing and iterative solvers.\r\n2. You will implement a PDE solver to predict ice flow dynamics on real topography.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this workshop, you will:\r\n- Have a GPU PDE solver that predicts ice-flow;\r\n- Have a concise Julia code that achieves similar performance than legacy C, CUDA, MPI code;\r\n- Be able to leverage the computing power of modern GPU accelerated servers and supercomputers.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to having you on board and will make sure to foster exchange of ideas and knowledge to provide an as inclusive as possible event.",

  "description": "The 'semantic release' framework (https://semantic-release.gitbook.io) builds upon the 'semantic versioning' (https://semver.org) and 'conventional commits' (https://www.conventionalcommits.org) specifications to bring release preparation closer to day-to-day operations.\r\n\r\nWhen the time rolls around for a new release of a Julia package, multiple decisions have to be made regarding which version number to assign, documenting what has changed, etc. This is not always a straightforward task. Gathering this information may require coordination within a group of people, or stretch long periods of time requiring effort to regain an overview of the current state of a package relative to the previous one to be able to document it. By adopting a specific commit message format, standard tooling can be used to extract this information automatically, whenever a release is desired. For instance, based on the content of commit messages the new semantic version can be determined, a changelog for the public API can be automatically generated, etc.\r\n\r\nAn argument can be made that, as all of this information is available in the version control system, there is no need for tooling such as this. However, the information contained in these systems is typically either too high-level due to sloppy commit messages, or it is too detailed requiring deep knowledge of the software to understand the implications of changes. It is typically not convenient for consumers of a Julia package to find out how a new release of a dependency affects their software.\r\n\r\nAdopting a 'semantic release' process benefits both developers and consumers of Julia software. For the former, it enables thinking about the impact of changes 'in the moment', instead of 'after the fact'. This is typically beneficial for the quality of documentation of these changes (e.g. reasons why, etc.). For the latter, it becomes easier to judge whether a new release of a dependency actually has an impact on their software.\r\n\r\nSlides are available at https://bauglir.gitlab.io/talks/juliacon-2021-semantically-releasing-julia-packages/.",

  "description": "eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is a virtual machine specification and machine code ISA originally designed for packet filtering in operating system kernels. eBPF is designed to be simple and compact enough to be trivially converted to native machine code, making it very portable across machine architectures. eBPF is developed in tandem with the Linux kernel, intended to be an internal runtime for safely executing user-defined code within the Linux kernel, where it allows users to introspect (and even modify) the functioning of their kernel's various subsystems. Given the key role that the OS kernel plays in allowing modern computers to function, it is thus no surprise that the ability to write and install eBPF kernels is considered a Linux \"superpower\".\r\n\r\nAs we can see from the example set by CUDA.jl, Julia is an excellent language for writing portable code which can execute on a variety of architectures with minimal changes. Recognizing this, I created BPFnative.jl as an interface from Julia to eBPF and the Linux kernel. BPFnative.jl allows users to write eBPF kernels in pure Julia, compile them into eBPF bytecode, and install them at various locations in the Linux kernel. This allows users with a minimal understanding of eBPF to explore their OS kernel at runtime, and thanks to the security measures and verifier built into the Linux eBPF VM, makes this a very safe thing to do.\r\n\r\nFor this talk, I will introduce the basics of eBPF and why Linux users should care about it, and then provide examples (including code snippets) of how to create eBPF kernels for introspecting various parts of the Linux kernel with BPFnative.jl. I will strive to make the examples relevant to everyday Linux users who want to find out more about what their OS is doing behind the scenes, without having to fully understand how the Linux kernel works. I will also encourage interested users to explore other parts of their OS with eBPF, and submit examples to BPFnative.jl to benefit the community.",

  "description": "Javis.jl is a general purpose library for creating Julia-based animations and visualizations across domains. At its core, Javis builds on the high level graphics library Luxor.jl and FFMPEG.jl for animation creation. Individuals who have difficulty effectively communicating ideas or findings statically, can easily use and extend Javis to construct informative, performant, and winsome animated graphics.\r\n\r\nIn this talk the audience will learn the key concepts of Javis by having a look into the abstraction system we use. Additionally they will see basic examples on how objects can interact to create powerful animations. A main point will be the interoperability with existing Julia packages like Luxor.jl and Animations.jl that we use to make the easiest experience for the user who already knows how to use Luxor for static art. Finally, the audience will come away with how Javis is already being used, what the future of Javis is, and how to get involved with the project.\r\n\r\nJavis is inspired by the Python-based animation engine, manim, created by Grant Sanderson (aka 3blue1brown) to visualize math concepts. Although inspired by manim, Javis has the greater goal of providing a general purpose animated graphics library. Historically, the Julia ecosystem has lacked a similar dedicated toolchain for the easy creation of complex animations. Javis is now filling that gap in the ecosystem - and beyond only mathematics.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the Julia ecosystem, the most similar packages to Javis are Reel.jl, Makie.jl, and Animations.jl. Javis differentiates itself from these packages by enabling its users to create visuals that may not be generally - or easily - supported by standard plotting packages. Although Javis uses a \"Frame\" concept similar to Reel.jl and Makie.jl, it is not only limited to plots and can create much more complicated visualizations than Animations.jl. Moreover, Javis has extensive documentation and tutorials to illustrate how to easily get started which is at times lacking within these similar packages. Finally, Javis has an active 40+ developer community where beginners can ask questions and participate in the open development path of Javis. Given that Javis users will not be limited by plotting conventions and having guidance in the form of high-quality tutorials and extensive documentation, the novelty and accessibility of Javis in the Julia space is high.\r\n\r\nAlready, Javis has seen steady adoption by users. For example, Javis has been used in secondary school settings to teach on topics such as physics and earth sciences. Increasingly, Javis is also being used for advanced visualizations. Further applications of Javis are in domain specific applications such as visualizing fourier series for signal processing use cases and mapping activity across the brain to view how the brain behaves under stress.\r\n\r\nDue to the extensible nature of Javis, Javis is poised to leverage the existing Julia ecosystem for further animations that users can take advantage of using. This integrative tooling comes as a result of a very open definition of how Javis defines an animation. This tooling enables a user to hook into packages, such as Animations.jl or Pluto.jl, to provide additional capabilities for fine-grained controls of animations, as in the case of Animations.jl, or reproducible development environments per Pluto.jl.",

  "description": "- Organisers: Marcelo Forets (@mforets) and Christian Schilling (@schillic)\r\n\r\n- Moderator: David P. Sanders (@dpsanders)\r\n\r\nA new generation of algorithms is addressing the fundamental challenge of how to exhaustively explore all possible scenarios for simulation of dynamical systems under model uncertainties. Moreover, deep neural networks play an increasing role in control and safety-critical applications, although it is often not known how to guarantee that they will behave correctly and safely under all circumstances. This minisymposium will host applications of set-based techniques and global optimization in Julia that address these questions.\r\n\r\nWe have made sure to reach out to several different groups who are working on set propagation techniques and their application in a wide range of areas, to present a broad overview of the area.\r\n\r\nPlan: 1 introductory talk (non-Julia-specific), 5 regular talks, 1 Q&A panel.\r\n\r\n- Introduction by Goran Frehse (Hybrid Systems Semantics group, Computer Science and System Engineering Laboratory (U2IS), ENSTA Paris. [Homepage](https://sites.google.com/site/frehseg/home).\r\n\r\n- **Using Set Propagation and the Finite Element Method For Time Integration in Transient Solid Mechanics Problems.**  By Jorge Pérez Zerpa (speaker), Marcelo Forets and Daniel Freire Caporale. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is the gold standard for numerical simulation in transient solid mechanics problems. Several time-integration algorithms have been developed in recent decades; however, it is still a challenging problem to completely describe the family of dynamically-feasible behaviors from given sets of initial states. In this talk we take a set-based approach and conclude that it has a lot of potential to efficiently solve such problems.\r\n\r\n- **Dionysos.jl: Optimal Control of Cyber-Physical Systems.** By Benoit Legat, Guillaume Berger, Julien Calbert (speaker) and Raphaël Jungers. [Dionysos.jl](https://github.com/dionysos-dev/Dionysos.jl) is software produced by the ERC project Learning to Control (L2C). In view of the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) revolution, the only sensible way of controlling these complex systems is by discretizing the different variables, thus transforming the model into a simple combinatorial problem on a finite-state automaton, called an abstraction of this system. Our goal is to transform this approach into an effective, scalable, cutting-edge technology that will address the challenges of CPS and unlock their potential.\r\n\r\n- **Solving Optimization Problems with Embedded Dynamical Systems.** By Matthew Wilhelm (speaker) and Matthew Stuber. We will discuss our recent work at [PSORLab](https://github.com/PSORLab): EAGODynamicOptimizer.jl and DynamicBounds.jl packages. These extend our EAGO.jl nonconvex optimizer to address formulations containing embedded dynamical systems. We highlight a series of approaches for constructing the requisite convex and concave relaxations of differential equations in the original decision space and discuss the use of such techniques in a global optimization context. These methods may readily be composed with existing McCormick relaxation approaches, which allows for the solution of general nonlinear formulations to certified global optimality. Use cases relevant to hybrid data-driven process modeling, parameter estimation, and worst-case robust design are discussed.\r\n\r\n- **Computing with sets of probabilities in Julia.** By Ander Gray. There are many ways to mathematically define a set of probability distributions, including: intervals, possibility distributions, random sets and probability boxes (p-boxes). These structures were discovered independently from one another, but are often synonymous and can be translated. Imprecise Probability theory links all these theories into one. In this presentation, we present [ProbabilityBoundsAnalysis.jl](https://github.com/AnderGray/ProbabilityBoundsAnalysis.jl) (PBA) a numerical implementation of p-box arithmetic in Julia, which gives an arithmetic of random variables where both marginal distributions and dependencies may be partially defined. We show how PBA may be used to rigorously propagate distributions and p-boxes in reachability problems using [ReachabilityAnalysis.jl](https://github.com/JuliaReach/ReachabilityAnalysis.jl).\r\n\r\n- **Methods to Soundly Verify Deep Neural Networks.** By Tomer Arnon. Deep neural networks are widely used for nonlinear function approximation, with applications ranging from computer vision to control. Although these networks involve the composition of simple arithmetic operations, it can be very challenging to verify whether a particular network satisfies certain input-output properties. [NeuralVerification.jl](https://github.com/sisl/NeuralVerification.jl) implements several methods that have emerged recently for soundly verifying such properties. We discuss fundamental differences between existing algorithms and compare them on a set of benchmark problems.",

  "description": "This project was done by a physics masters student at École Polytechnique Féderale de Lausanne under the orientation of prof. Fréderic Mila and PhD student Jeanne Colbois.\r\nLattice models are prolific in the field of Statistical Physics, as they are simple to state but allow for studying the most important aspects of the behaviour of complex systems, such as critical behaviour and phase transition.\r\nAll the macroscopic properties of a given model can be obtained from the knowledge of its partition function. However, analytic computation of this quantity isn't always feasible, and usually numerical techniques need to be employed. \r\nExamples of such methods include Monte Carlo and Tensor Networks. The main advantage of the Tensor Network formulation is that it exploits the translation symmetry of the model, which allows it to describe the system in the thermodynamic limit.\r\nIn this project we used the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalisation Group (CTMRG) algorithm, which exploits the properties of the Singular Value Decomposition to find a lower-dimensional representation of the lattice surrounding a site. \r\nThe choice of the Julia programming language was natural as it possessed the two qualities that were most important to me as a developer - fast performance and convenient syntax. The existence of a library specifically meant to deal with tensor networks - ITensors - also played a role in the choice. \r\nThe vast library of numerical libraries mantained by the Julia community, such as KrylovKit.jl and LsqFit.jl also proved to be extremely useful.",

Plots are an obvious example of this. Additionally, in reinforcement learning, for example, other forms of visualizations are often used to test out an environment, and also to analyze the behavior of an agent in the environment at various points during its training process.\r\n\r\nWhile developing complex programs, it often pays off well to write visualization tools from an early stage, especially when the correctness of a program cannot be verified via writing test cases alone. Reinforcement learning environments, or any kinds of games for that matter, are a good example of this. In many cases, people may overestimate the cost of creating such tools relative to the value they provide, and might perceive such a task to be more challenging than it actually is. I am here to show you that in some cases, it is much easier than you might think.\r\n\r\nThe Julia REPL offers several valuable features, often making it an indispensable part of a Julia user’s workflow in some form or another. It is possible to take this one step further and create interactive terminal-based visualizations that unlock even more productive workflows while using the REPL.\r\n\r\nI will showcase some relevant features from the GridWorlds.jl package as a concrete example of increased developer productivity using interactive terminal-based visualizations in the REPL. In this package, plain keyboard inputs allow one to rapidly test and debug tile-based reinforcement learning environments by directly visualizing and playing them inside the terminal. One can instantly switch back and forth between testing an environment and debugging it in the REPL in the same REPL session without losing the local state. Additionally, one can also record these interactions and replay them inside the REPL by stepping through the individual frames. This feature also proves extremely handy when analyzing the behavior of an agent at various points during training.\r\n\r\nI will deconstruct the essential pieces necessary to create and run such a visualization inside the terminal and explain how it can be built from scratch, only utilizing things that already ship with Julia.\r\n\r\nThe techniques and tricks explained in this talk are much more generally applicable. I encourage everyone to think about how you can creatively augment your current workflow to make it even more productive and engaging for your domain.",

  "description": "Most Earth-system simulations run on conventional CPUs in 64-bit double precision floating-point numbers Float64, although the need for high precision calculations in the presence of large uncertainties has been questioned. The world’s fastest supercomputer, Fugaku, is based on [A64FX microprocessors](https://www.fujitsu.com/global/products/computing/servers/supercomputer/a64fx/), which also support the 16-bit low precision format Float16. We investigate the Float16 performance on A64FX with [ShallowWaters.jl](https://github.com/milankl/ShallowWaters.jl), a fluid circulation model that was written with a focus on 16-bit arithmetics. It implements techniques that address precision and dynamic range issues in 16 bit. The precision-critical time integration is augmented to include Kahan’s compensated summation to reduce rounding errors. Such a compensated time integration is as precise but faster than mixing 16 and 32-bit of precision. The very limited dynamic range available in Float16 is 6e-5 to 65504, as subnormals are inefficiently supported on A64FX. The bitpattern histogram analysis at runtime with [Sherlogs.jl](https://github.com/milankl/Sherlogs.jl) as well as its functionality to record stacktraces conditioned on the occurrence of subnormals were invaluable to limit the arithmetic range. Consequently, we benchmark speed-ups of 3.8x on A64FX with Float16 and 3.6x with compensated time integration to minimize model degradation. Although ShallowWaters.jl is simplified compared to large Earth-system models, it shares essential algorithms and therefore shows that 16-bit calculations on A64FX are indeed a competitive way to accelerate Earth-system simulations on available hardware.\r\n\r\nThis work used the [Isambard UK National Tier-2 HPC Service](http://gw4.ac.uk/isambard/) operated by GW4 and the UK Met Office, and funded by EPSRC.\r\n\r\nCo-authors  \r\n- [Sam Hatfield](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/media-centre/news/2020/accelerating-weather-forecasting-models-using-reduced-precision), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, UK \r\n- [Matteo Croci](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/matteo.croci), Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, UK\r\n- [Peter Düben](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/who-we-are/staff-profiles/peter-dueben), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, UK\r\n- [Tim Palmer](https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/contacts/people/palmer), University of Oxford, UK",

  "description": "Agent based modelling (ABM) is a simulation method in which autonomous agents react to their environment, given a predefined set of rules. It is a bottom-up approach for modelling and simulating complex systems, such as behavior, decision making, crowd dynamics and other socio-economic problems; as well as, but not limited to, complex natural sciences such as chemical reactions or biological processes.\r\nSince ABMs are not described by simple and concise mathematical equations, code that generates them is typically complicated, large, and slow. In addition, since many of these problems are very domain specific, a lot of ABMs are hand written from scratch.\r\nAgents.jl provides a solution to this complication. Acknowledging that ABM frameworks have existed for decades, we show that Agents.jl is not only the most performant, but also the least complicated software (in terms of lines of code written to implement well-known ABM test cases), providing the same (and sometimes more) features as competitors.\r\nThis enables rapid prototyping of your domain specific ABM, with tried and tested (but generic) tooling.\r\nThe talk will provide an introduction to many of these helpful features, as well as showcase how well it integrates with the entire Julia ecosystem. Interactive applications with Makie.jl, differential equations from DifferentialEquations.jl, parameter optimization from BlackboxOptim.jl, and more.\r\nTo conclude, we'll outline some of the big next-steps on the roadmap that other ABM frameworks will struggle to match in the absence of the Julia ecosystem.",

Agents.jl provides a framework to work with such dynamics, through a bottom-up approach known as Agent Based Modelling. This talk provides an overview of the package, and discusses how the greater Julia ecosystem may provide the next paradigm shift in this well established research area."

  "description": "Constraint programming is a modelling paradigm that has proved to be extremely useful in many real-world scenarios, like computing optimum schedules or vehicle routings. It is often viewed as either a complementary or a competing technology to mathematical programming, trading modelling ease with computational efficiency. Both approaches have seen many developments in terms of modelling language and solvers alike, including in Julia. Even though several constraint-programming solvers are available (or entirely written) in Julia, [JuMP and MathOptInterface](https://jump.dev/) (its solver abstraction layer) do not give access to them in the same, unified way as mathematical programming, though the latest versions of JuMP have been designed to provide great flexibility. \r\n\r\n[ConstraintProgrammingExtensions](https://github.com/dourouc05/ConstraintProgrammingExtensions.jl) is currently a one-man project bringing constraint programming to JuMP. Its main part is a large series of sets that aim at providing a common interface for constraint-programming solvers. It also consists of a series of bridges that define relationships between those sets (including between high-level constraints such as knapsacks and mathematical-programming formulations) and of a [FlatZinc](https://www.minizinc.org/) reader-writer to import and export models in that common format, already supported by tens of solvers. As a side effect, ConstraintProgrammingExtensions is also becoming a way to ease modelling for mathematical programming, as high-level constraints can be used with traditional mathematical-programming solvers. \r\n\r\nThis presentation details the current state of ConstraintProgrammingExtensions, some of its design decisions, and future developments when JuMP and MathOptInterface do not provide sufficient versatility: for instance, several constraint-programming solvers allow graphs as first-class decision variables; also, constraint programming is not restricted by the linearity or the convexity of mathematical expressions, unlike many mathematical-programming solvers.",

  "description": "Julia is known for its speed, but how can you keep making things faster after all of the standard code optimization tricks run out? The answer is machine learning reduced or approximate models. JuliaSim is an extension to the Julia SciML ecosystem for automatically generating machine learning surrogates which accurately reproduce model behavior. In this talk we will showcase how you can take your existing ModelingToolkit.jl models and automate the model order reduction of its components. By hooking into the hierarchical modeling ecosystem, this allows for using the same surrogate across many models without requiring retraining. We will show the benefits of this process on energy efficient building design, which has been accelerated by orders of magnitude over the Dymola Modelica implementation, by using neural surrogatized HVAC models. We will demo simultaneous translation and acceleration of components designed outside of Julia through JuliaSim's ability to take in Functional Markup Units (FMUs) from Modelica and Simulink, along with domain-specific modeling definitions like SPICE netlists of electrical circuits and Pumas pharmacometic models. Similarly, this system allows for generating digital twins of real objects through its measurements, allowing one to quickly incorporate components with less physical understanding directly through its data. We will show a JuliaHub-based parallelized training platform that allows offloading the training process to the cloud. This will allow for engineers to pull pre-accelerated models from the ever growing JuliaSim Model Store directly into their Julia-based designs for fast exploration. Together this will leave the audience ready to integrate ML-accelerated modeling and simulation tools into their workflows.",

  "description": "Invertible neural networks (INNs) are designed around bijective building blocks that allow the evaluation of (deep) INNs in both directions, which means that inputs into the network (and all internal states) can be uniquely re-computed from the output. INNs were popularized in the context of normalizing flows as an alternative approach to generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational auto-encoders (VAEs), but their property of invertibility is also appealing for discriminative models, as INNs allow memory-efficient backpropagation during training. As hidden states can be recomputed for INNs from the output, it is in principle not required to save the state during forward evaluation, thus leading to a significantly lower memory imprint than conventional neural networks. However, existing backpropagation libraries that are used in TensorFlow or PyTorch do not support the concept of invertibility and therefore require work arounds to benefit from them. For this reason, current frameworks for INNs such as FrEIA or MemCNN use layer-wise AD, in which backpropagation is performed by first re-computing the hidden state of the current layer and then using PyTorch's AD tool (Autograd) to compute the gradients for the respective layer. This approach is computationally not efficient, as it performs an additional forward pass during backpropagation.\r\n\r\nWith InvertibleNetworks.jl, we present an open-source Julia framework (MIT license) with manually implemented gradients, in which we take advantage of the invertibility of building blocks. For each invertible layer, we provide a backpropagation layer that (re-)computes the hidden state and weight updates all at once, thus not requiring an extra (layer-wise) forward evaluation. In addition to gradients, InvertibleNetworks.jl also provides Jacobians for each layer (i.e. forward differentiation), or more precisely, matrix-free implementations of Jacobian-vector products, as well as log-determinants for normalizing flows. While backpropagation and Jacobians are implemented manually, InvertibleNetworks.jl integrates seamlessly with ChainRules.jl, so users do not need to manually define backward passes for implemented networks. Additionally, InvertibleNetworks.jl is compatible with Flux.jl, so that users can create networks that consist of a mix of invertible and non-invertible Flux layers. In this talk, we present the architecture and features of InvertibleNetworks.jl, which includes implementations of common invertible layers from the literature, and show its application to a range of scenarios including loop-unrolled imaging, uncertainty quantification with normalizing flows and large-scale image segmentation.",

  "description": "The main algorithmic challenge is that R-vine arrays, which encode pairwise decompositions of the joint likelihood function into bivariate copula functions, are order N^2 in the cardinality of the dataset. For even modest-sized datasets therefore, implementing the R-vine arrays as dense collections requires traversing a huge amount of individual copula instances, even when most of them are expected to be trivial. This results in large memory footprint and enormous computing times for the basic inference operations, such as likelihood evaluation and sampling.\r\n\r\nMy package uses sparse data structures to reduce the memory required for object storage and to significantly speed up likelihood evaluations and sampling.",

  "description": "Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a common nasopharyngeal bacterium that can cause invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Each component of current vaccines generally induce immunity to one of the approximately 100 pneumococcal types. Overall carriage rates remain similar to pre-vaccination as the serotypes not affected by the vaccine will replace the affected ones. Selecting which serotypes to target to minimize the post-vaccine IPD burden is a challenging combinatorial problem involving a large ODE system describing the population dynamics of the bacteria in response to each proposed vaccine. This talk describes how I have approached this problem using automatic differentiation, parallelized evaluation of the ODEs, stochastic search and Bayesian optimization.",

PMD includes several nonlinear AC formulations, linear approximations, and relaxations, all based on state-of-the-art peer-reviewed research, and has native support for both single-period and multi-period (time series) problems, the latter of which is especially relevant due to the larger number of energy storage components appearing in power distribution networks. PMD includes a native Julia OpenDSS data format parser, allowing us to validate the results of AC power flow against OpenDSS using a number of IEEE distribution test feeders, and provides a simple avenue to support existing data models for a broad collection of distribution system components such as photovoltaic systems and energy storage.",

  "description": "Sometimes you want to generate definitions for many methods. Consider for example  implementing there delegation pattern. Where you have a field of a different type, and you want to overload all methods that accept that field’s type to also accept this new object, and have them just delegate to calling the method on the field. Ideally this wouldn’t come up and you would just need to implement a small well documented set for an interface. But sometimes things can’t be ideal. Generating overloads from the method table is one way to take a jack-hammer to blast through the problem. But even outside that it can be useful as this talk will discuss.\r\n\r\n[ExprTools.jl](https://github.com/invenia/ExprTools.jl) was created to hold a more robust version of `splitdef` and `combinedef` from [MacroTools.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/MacroTools.jl).\r\n`splitdef` takes the AST for a method definition and outputs a dictionary of all the parts: name, args, whereparams, body etc. `combinedef` does the reverse: taking such a dictionary, and outputting an AST that declares the method.\r\n`splitdef` is very useful since it both handles different equivalent syntax forms, and makes the key parts accessible in a consistent way.\r\nThis makes it easier to write function decorator macros, and also macros that let the user write something that looks like a function but is actually transformed into something else.\r\nThis dictionary is also useful, and it would be great if we could define it not from an AST but from a method that has already been defined. We could access all the information we need via reflection. This is exactly what the `signature` function provides.\r\n\r\nThe `signature` function takes in a `Method` object, which can be obtained from `methods` or `methodswith`, and returns a dictionary like `splitdef` would, except it excludes the body.\r\nExcluding the body is generally not useful for this kind of generated code anyway since the user will generally want to fill the body with their own code that calls the method we are generating from. One exampl. Another example is generating overloaded operators for overloading-based reverse mode AD from [ChainRules.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ChainRules.jl/)’s rrule.\r\n\r\nThe main alternative for this kind of approach is something along the lines of [Cassette.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLabs/Cassette.jl), which in effect allows the overloading of what it means to call a function. There are three key differences of an ExprTools-based generation from reflection approach over a Cassette-based overdubbing approach.\r\n\r\nOverdubbing occurs in a specific dynamically scoped context, method generation applies globally.\r\nA downside of method generation is that it will not detect new methods added after the generation is performed, overdubbing does.\r\nAn upside of method generation is that it is just plain julia code, so it doesn’t break the compiler’s ability to do type inference. The compiler is completely prepared to deal with julia-code. This is (sadly, but demonstrably) not true for Cassette right now.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis talk will spend ~3 minutes time covering the basics of ExprTools, with `splitdef` and `combine`. It will spend 4 minutes demonstrating `signature` and the generation of methods from the methods tables. It will spend ~1 minutes peeking under the covers as to how it works.",

  "description": "To introduce FunSQL, we will construct a practical query from healthcare informatics and then discuss how it works. We use a fragment of the [OMOP Common Data Model](https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel), a cross-platform database model for observational healthcare data.\r\n\r\nAs typical in healthcare, this schema is patient-centric. The table `person` contains de-identified information about patients including the unique identifier, approximate birthdate, and demographic information. To make this table available for FunSQL, we define it as follows.\r\n<pre>\r\nconst person =\r\n    SQLTable(:person, columns = [:person_id, :year_of_birth, :location_id])\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe `patient` table has a foreign key to `location`, which specifies geographic location, typically down to a zipcode.\r\n<pre>\r\nconst location =\r\n    SQLTable(:location, columns = [:location_id, :city, :state, :zip])\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nEach person is associated with clinical events: encounters with care providers, recorded observations, diagnosed conditions, performed procedures, etc. We will represent one of them.\r\n<pre>\r\nconst visit_occurrence =\r\n    SQLTable(:visit_occurrence, columns = [:visit_occurrence_id, :person_id, :visit_start_date])\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nWith this background in place, let us suppose a physician scientist asks:\r\n\r\n*When was the last time each person, born in 2000 or earlier and living in Illinois, was seen by a care provider?*\r\n\r\nThis research question could be answered using FunSQL.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nFrom(person) |>\r\nWhere(Get.year_of_birth .<= 2000) |>\r\nJoin(:location => From(location),\r\n     on = (Get.location_id .== Get.location.location_id)) |>\r\nWhere(Get.location.state .== \"IL\") |>\r\nJoin(:visit_group => From(visit_occurrence) |>\r\n                     Group(Get.person_id),\r\n     on = (Get.person_id .== Get.visit_group.person_id),\r\n     left = true) |>\r\nSelect(Get.person_id,\r\n       :max_visit_start_date =>\r\n           Get.visit_group |> Agg.Max(Get.visit_start_date))\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nFunSQL provides operations with familiar SQL names such as `From`, `Where`, `Join`, `Group`, and `Select`, which can be chained together using the `|>` operator. The notation `:location => From(location)`, and its counterpart `Get.location.state`, lets us arrange table attributes hierarchically. Most importantly, the query can be constructed and tested incrementally, one operation at a time.\r\n\r\nContrast this with a hand-crafted SQL query.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nSELECT p.person_id, MAX(vo.visit_start_date)\r\nFROM person p\r\nJOIN location l ON (p.location_id = l.location_id)\r\nLEFT JOIN visit_occurrence vo ON (p.person_id = vo.person_id)\r\nWHERE (p.year_of_birth <= 2000) AND (l.state = 'IL')\r\nGROUP BY p.person_id\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nAlthough the SQL query is compact, it cannot be incrementally constructed. Indeed, if we follow the progression of the research question, we arrive at:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nFROM person p\r\nWHERE (p.year_of_birth <= 2000)\r\nJOIN location l ON (p.location_id = l.location_id)\r\n...\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nBut this is not valid SQL.  SQL enforces a rigid order of clauses: `FROM`, `JOIN`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`. As we refine a SQL query, attempting to incrementally correlate it with the research question, we are always forced to backtrack and rebuild it. This is what makes SQL tedious and error-prone.\r\n\r\nFunSQL solves the problem of compositional query construction by representing individual operations as subqueries with a deferred `SELECT` list.\r\n<pre>\r\nq1 AS (SELECT ... FROM person)\r\nq2 AS (SELECT ... FROM q1 WHERE q1.year_of_birth <= 2000)\r\nq3 AS (SELECT ... FROM location)\r\nq4 AS (SELECT ...

For instance, references `q1.year_of_bith`, `q2.location_id`, `q5.person_id` force `q1` to take the following form.\r\n<pre>\r\nq1 AS (SELECT person_id, year_of_birth, location_id FROM person)\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThis `SELECT` resolution also propagates aggregate expressions. Thus, `q7` becomes:\r\n<pre>\r\nq7 AS (SELECT q6.person_id,\r\n              MAX(q6.visit_start_date) AS max_visit_start_date\r\n       FROM q6\r\n       GROUP BY q6.person_id)\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThis approach provides a uniform compositional interface to the variety of SQL operations, preserving the expressive power of SQL while eliminating its stifling inflexibility.\r\n\r\nFor a Julia programmer, FunSQL realizes query operations as 1st class objects.

An alternative method is to perform the search sequentially starting with __m__ using surrogates __p__ and __h__ followed by searching for __p__ using optimal __m__ and surrogate __h__, and finally searching for __h__ using optimal __p__ and __m__ found. This alternative technique only involves n(p) + n(m) + n(h) search space which is significantly smaller than simultaneously searching __p__, __m__, and __h__. We find in our experiments using the [AutoMLPipeline](https://github.com/IBM/AutoMLPipeline.jl) package, that in many cases, it is sufficient to just search for __m__ and __p__ to achieve competitive performance with those of other optimal algorithms that searches all three components simultaneously.\r\n\r\nRelevant Julia Packages used in the talk:\r\n- [AutoMLPipeline.jl](https://github.com/IBM/AutoMLPipeline.jl)\r\n- [AMLPipelineBase.jl](https://github.com/IBM/AMLPipelineBase.jl)\r\n- [Lale.jl](https://github.com/IBM/Lale.jl)\r\n- [Hyperopt.jl](https://github.com/baggepinnen/Hyperopt.jl)",

  "description": "Recently, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations has emerged as a powerful framework for modeling physical simulations without explicitly defining the ODEs governing the system, but instead learning them via machine learning. However, the question: “Can Bayesian learning frameworks be integrated with Neural ODE’s to robustly quantify the uncertainty in the weights of a Neural ODE?” remains unanswered. In an effort to address this question, we primarily evaluate the following categories of inference methods: (a) The No-U-Turn MCMC sampler (NUTS), (b) Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) and (c) Stochastic Langevin Gradient Descent (SGLD). We demonstrate the successful integration of Neural ODEs with the above Bayesian inference frameworks on classical physical systems, as well as on standard machine learning datasets like MNIST, using GPU acceleration. On the MNIST dataset, we achieve a posterior sample accuracy of 98.5% on the test ensemble  of 10,000 images.  This is a performance competitive with current state-of-the-art image classification methods, which meanwhile lack our method's ability to quantify the confidence in its predictions. \r\n\r\nSubsequently, for the first time, we demonstrate the successful integration of variational inference with normalizing flows and Neural ODEs, leading to a powerful Bayesian Neural ODE object. \r\n\r\nFinally, considering a predator-prey model and an epidemiological system, we demonstrate the probabilistic identification of model specification in partially-described dynamical systems using universal ordinary differential equations. Together, this gives a scientific machine learning tool for probabilistic estimation of epistemic uncertainties.\r\n\r\nIn this study, we used the Julia differentiable programming stack to compose the Julia differential equation solvers with the Turing probabilistic programming language. The study was performed without modifications to the underlying libraries due to the composability afforded by the differentiable programming stack.",

  "description": "To handle the high rate of data produced by multiple view light-sheet microscopy requires processing gigabtyes per seconds in order to overcome the limitations of microscope attached storage. Additionally since the data involves six dimensions, three spatial dimensions across time, wavelength, and view, there is a need to efficiently store the data in the form of localized subvolume blocks. I will discuss the experience of using Julia in combination with other tools in C++, Java, and LabView to handle data unpacking, compression, chunking and storage.\r\nMicroscopy data is collected by scientific cameras via frame grabbers which emit frames of 8, 12, or 16-bit unsigned integers depending on the configuration of the experiment. Collecting 12-bit data  is a popular choice since it provides a large dynamic range relative to 8-bit data over thousands of integer values while allowing for relatively fast acquisition and moderate data throughput versus 16-bit data. Since 12-bit data is usually packed and not aligned to byte boundaries, processing the data posses an initial problem that complicates data handling and compression. Successfully addressing this problem allows for biological experiments under the microscope to be extended since the data requires less storage or transfer bandwidth.\r\nJulia’s abstract array interfaces as well as its ability to access low level vector intrinsics through SIMD.jl that allow for effective initial handling of 12-bit integers with the help of the BitIntegers.jl package. This enables the data to be efficiently processed in part or in whole. Also, this provides opportunities to rearrange, or shuffle, the data to prepare it for compression. Through APIs such as TranscodingStreams.jl, Julia code can access a multitude of compression schemes which allow for rapid prototyping. Additionally, Julia’s ability to access native and asynchronous I/O allows for flexible storage through multiple formats which allow for automatic chunking and division into subvolumes. An example of this is the ImarisWriter.jl library produced as part of our efforts.\r\nA key aspect of using Julia in such an environment is it’s ability to interoperate with multiple languages. Many of the tools that we needed to integrate have C or C++ interfaces, and Julia excelled at efficiently calling them without the need of much effort. Additionally, the ability to embed Julia in other applications such as LabView makes it easy to integrate the developed Julia code with existing solutions. Finally, much of the tooling for downstream image analysis exists in Java so the ability to use JavaCall.jl to integrate the near acquisition and image processing is another critical feature.\r\nOverall, the experience of using Julia for near acquisition microscopy tasks has been successful and rewarding. We’ve been able to use Julia to address complex tasks in real time in order to meet demanding needs, and this is greatly facilitated by Julia’s flexibility of both high-level abstraction and low level efficient code compilation. Ultimately, it has been the ease of use factor which has allowed my colleagues and I to adopt Julia as a critical technology in our workflow.",

  "description": "Feature engineering is an essential component in all machine learning and data science workflows. It is often an exploratory activity in which the pipeline for a particular set of features tends to be developed iteratively as new data or insights are incorporated. \r\n\r\nAs the feature complexity grows over time it is very common for code to devolve into unwieldy “pipeline jungles” [1], which pose multiple problems to developers. They are often brittle, with highly-coupled operations that make it increasingly difficult to make isolated changes. The over-entanglement of such pipelines also means they are difficult to unit test and debug effectively, making them particularly error-prone. Since adding to this complexity is often easier than investing in refactoring it, pipeline jungles tend to be more susceptible to incurring technical debt over time, which can impact the project’s long-term success.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will showcase some of the key features of the [FeatureTransforms.jl](https://github.com/invenia/FeatureTransforms.jl) package, such as the composability, reusability, and performance of common transform operations, that were designed to help mitigate the problems in our own pipeline jungles.. \r\n\r\n[FeatureTransforms.jl](https://github.com/invenia/FeatureTransforms.jl) is conceptually different from other widely-known packages that provide similar utilities for manipulating data, such as [DataFramesMeta.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFramesMeta.jl), [DataKnots.jl](https://github.com/rbt-lang/DataKnots.jl), and [Query.jl](https://github.com/queryverse/Query.jl). These packages provide methods for composing relational operations to filter, join, or combine structured data. However, a query-based syntax or an API that only supports one type are not the most suitable for composing the kinds of mathematical transformations, such as one-hot-encoding, that underpin most (non-trivial) feature engineering pipelines, which this package aims to provide.\r\n\r\nThe composability of transforms reflects the practice of piping the output of one operation to the input of another, as well as combining the pipelines of multiple features. Reusability is achieved by having native support for the Tables and AbstractArray interfaces, which includes tables such as [DataFrames](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl/), [TypedTables](https://github.com/JuliaData/TypedTables.jl), [LibPQ.Result](https://github.com/invenia/LibPQ.jl), etc, and arrays such as [AxisArrays](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/AxisArrays.jl), [KeyedArrays](https://github.com/mcabbott/AxisKeys.jl), and [NamedDimsArrays](https://github.com/invenia/NamedDims.jl). This flexible design allows for performant code that should satisfy the needs of most users while not being restricted to (or by) any one data type.\r\n\r\n[1] [Sculley, David, et al. \"Hidden technical debt in machine learning systems.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 28 (2015): 2503-2511](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2015/hash/86df7dcfd896fcaf2674f757a2463eba-Abstract.html).",

  "description": "The Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) is the Department of Energy's state-of-the-art earth system simulation model. It aims to address the most critical and challenging climate problems by efficiently utilizing DOE’s advanced HPC systems. One of the challenges of E3SM (and other exascale simulations) is the imbalance between the great size of the generated simulation data and the limited storage capacity. This means that post hoc data analysis needs to be replaced with in-situ analysis, which analyzes simulation data as the simulation is running. Our work aims to use Julia to provide data scientists with a high-level and performant interface for developing in-situ data analysis algorithms without directly interacting with complex HPC codes. This talk discusses (1) high-level Julia runtime coupling with E3SM, (2) two in-situ data analysis modules in Julia, and (3) low-level communication between E3SM and the in-situ Julia modules.\r\n\r\nIn this project, we focus on the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM), which models the atmosphere and is one of E3SM’s coupled modules. Our goal is to study extreme weather events that happen in the atmosphere, such as sudden stratospheric warmings (SSW) that can destabilize the polar vortex and cause extreme cold temperatures on earth surfaces. The primary design consideration of coupling Julia with E3SM is the identification of an appropriate entry point in E3SM’s CAM for calling in-situ Julia modules. CAM is implemented in Fortran and simulates in the timestep style. The control module of CAM has access to the simulation data and is selected to be interfaced with the Julia runtime. To couple E3SM with Julia, (1) we have implemented a Fortran-based in-situ data adapter in the control module of CAM, which takes the CAM simulation data as input and internally passes the data to the Julia runtime. (2) We have implemented a C-based interface between the in-situ data adapter and the in-situ Julia modules. The C interface includes three major functions: initialization, cleanup and worker, which creates an in-situ Julia instance (by loading and initializing the in-situ Julia module from a specified path), destroys the Julia instance, and passes the data from the in-situ adapter to the in-situ Julia instance. Our Fortran in-situ adapter interface calls the worker function at every time step and initialization/cleanup functions at the first/last time step. (3) As E3SM mixes the usage of GNU Make and CMake for combining and compiling different E3SM components, we have added the Julia compilation flags for the C and Fortran interfaces into the CAM CMake file (i.e., header files) and the top-level GNU Make file (i.e., Julia libraries). The in-situ Julia module is only compiled when it is called during runtime, which avoids compiling the whole E3SM if the in-situ Julia module needs to be changed.\r\n\r\nWe have implemented two data analysis in-situ modules: linear regression and SSW. This linear regression approach models simulation variables as a function of simulation time. It can be used to track trends in variables of interest and to identify important checkpoints in the simulation. SSW characterizes midwinter stratospheric sudden warmings that often cause splitting of the stratospheric polar vortex. By definition, SSW occurs when the zonal mean of the zonal wind becomes reversed (easterly) at 60°N and 10 hPa and lasts for at least 10 consecutive days. This event can lead to extreme temperatures on the surface in northern America.\r\n\r\nThe worker function in the C interface aims to support efficient low-level data communication between E3SM and the in-situ Julia modules. To run at large-scale, E3SM adopts Message Passing Interface (MPI) and so the data is distributed among all the MPI ranks. Each MPI rank of CAM has access to only a local data block of CAM variables (e.g., velocity and temperature) and passes its local data block in 1D array to its own in-situ Julia instance through the C interface. When the in-situ Julia instance needs remote data (e.g., for computation of SSW) from other in-situ Julia instances, MPI.jl is used to implement the data communication between different in-situ Julia instances. However, one key design challenge is to make sure that E3SM and Julia use the same MPI communicator for correct data communication and this is challenging as current Julia C embeddings are not able to directly pass the MPI communicator. To address this challenge, we have developed two converters (i.e., in both C and Fortran formats) of MPI communicators for supporting different MPI libraries. Last, we have also evaluated the performance (i.e., overall overhead) of the worker function for providing valuable guidelines of running HPC applications with Julia at large-scale.",

  "description": "Gridap is a new, open-source, finite element (FE) library implemented in the Julia programming language. The main goal of Gridap is to adopt a more modern programming style than existing FE applications written in C/C++ or Fortran in order to simplify the simulation of challenging problems in science and engineering and improve productivity in the research of new discretization methods. The library is a feature-rich general-purpose FE code able to solve a wide range of partial differential equations (PDEs), including linear, nonlinear, and multi-physics problems. Gridap is extensible and modular. One can implement new FE spaces, new reference elements, and use external mesh generators, linear solvers, and visualization tools. In addition, it blends perfectly well with other packages of the Julia package ecosystem, since Gridap is implemented 100% in Julia.\r\n\r\nOne of the distinctive features of the library is a high-level API allowing one to simulate complex PDEs with very few lines of code. This API makes possible to write the PDE weak form in a syntax almost identical to the mathematical notation. In some sense, the high-level API of Gridap resembles to the one of FE codes based on symbolic domain-specific languages like UFL in FEniCS, but, in contrast, Gridap does not consider any compiler of variational forms nor C/C++ code generation facilities. Instead, the library takes advantage of the Julia JIT compiler to generate efficient machine code for the particular problem the user wants to solve, which makes the Gridap much easier to maintain and extend.\r\n\r\nThe Gridap project was initially presented in last year's JuliaCon. Since then, a number of new important features have been added, including an enhanced syntax for writing the PDE weak form, the support of more PDE types, and the support of more numerical techniques. In JuliaCon2021, we would like to showcase these updates via a set of representative use cases and challenging applications such as fluid-structure interaction problems.",

  "description": "Stochastic models, especially Markov process models, find numerous applications across various fields such as mathematical finance, control theory and systems biology, for example. While in many of these applications stochastic models offer crucial fidelity over their deterministic counterparts, their analysis is generally more involved. In particular, even the simplest stochastic models rarely admit an analytical solution such that numerical approximation techniques dominate the analysis of stochastic models in practice. Many such techniques, however, rely on unverifiable assumptions and only few provide mechanisms to rigorously quantify the induced approximation error. Recently developed moment bounding schemes [1-7] seek to address this shortcoming. By means of convex optimization, such bounding schemes enable the computation of hard, theoretically guaranteed bounds on the stationary as well as transient moments associated with jump-diffusion processes with polynomial data. While the Julia ecosystem has everything in store to set up and solve the respective optimization problems through JuMP with the help of extensions like MomentOpt.jl and SumOfSquares.jl, it still requires expert knowledge to do so. To close this gap and make moment bounding more accessible to practitioners with a diverse background, we present the meta-package MarkovBounds.jl which integrates the functionalities of the aforementioned packages to automatically generate and solve the respective moment bounding problems from high-level input data. \r\n\r\nIn this brief talk, we sketch the idea of moment bounding schemes and showcase with toy examples drawn from stochastic chemical kinetics and mathematical finance how MarkovBounds.jl enables non-expert users to readily apply them.\r\n\r\n[1]  Garrett R.

It knows how to format tuples, named tuples, vectors, sets, and dictionaries.\r\n\r\nPrettyPrinting can also serialize `Expr` nodes as Julia code.  It supports a fair subset of Julia syntax including top-level declarations, statements, and expressions.\r\n\r\nThe ability of PrettyPrinting to format `Expr` nodes makes it easy to extend `pprint()` to user-defined data types.  Indeed, it is customary to display a Julia object as a valid Julia expression that constructs the object.  This could be done by converting the object to `Expr` and having `pprint()` format\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFor example, let us define a type `MyNode` modeled after the standard `Expr` type.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\njulia> struct MyNode\r\n           head\r\n           args\r\n           MyNode(head, args...) = new(head, args)\r\n        end\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe default implementation of `show()` is not aware of the custom constructor. Moreover, it dumps the whole object in a single line, making it difficult to read.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\njulia> tree = MyNode(\"1\",\r\n                     MyNode(\"1.1\", MyNode(\"1.1.1\"), MyNode(\"1.1.2\"), MyNode(\"1.1.3\")),\r\n                     MyNode(\"1.2\", MyNode(\"1.2.1\"), MyNode(\"1.2.2\"), MyNode(\"1.2.3\")))\r\nMyNode(\"1\", (MyNode(\"1.1\", (MyNode(\"1.1.1\", ()), MyNode(\"1.1.2\", ()), MyNode(\"1.1.3\", …\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nWe implement function `quoteof(::MyNode)` to convert `MyNode` to `Expr`.  We can also override the default implementation of `show()` to make it use `pprint()`.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\njulia> PrettyPrinting.quoteof(n::MyNode) =\r\n           :(MyNode($(quoteof(n.head)), $((quoteof(arg) for arg in n.args)...)))\r\n\r\njulia> Base.show(io::IO, ::MIME\"text/plain\", n::MyNode) =\r\n           pprint(io, n)\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nNow the output is correct Julia code that fits the screen width.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\njulia> tree\r\nMyNode(\"1\",\r\n       MyNode(\"1.1\", MyNode(\"1.1.1\"), MyNode(\"1.1.2\"), MyNode(\"1.1.3\")),\r\n       MyNode(\"1.2\", MyNode(\"1.2.1\"), MyNode(\"1.2.2\"), MyNode(\"1.2.3\")))\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nInternally, PrettyPrinting represents all potential layouts of a data structure in the form of a *layout expression* assembled from atomic layouts, vertical and horizontal composition, and the choice operator.  The layout cost function estimates how well the layout fits the screen dimensions.  The algorithm for finding the optimal layout is a clever application of dynamic programming, which is described in [Phillip Yelland, A New Approach to Optimal Code Formatting, 2016](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44667).",

  "description": "Bayesian inference is one of the key computational mechanisms that underlies probabilistic model-based machine learning applications such as time series prediction, image and speech recognition, and robotics. Unfortunately, for many models of practical interest, Bayesian inference requires evaluating high-dimensional integrals that have no analytical solution. As a result, Probabilistic Programming (PP) tools for Automated Approximate Bayesian Inference (AABI) have become popular, e.g., Turing.jl, Soss.jl, ForneyLab.jl, Pyro, and others. These tools help researchers to define custom probabilistic models in a high-level domain-specific language and run AABI algorithms with minimal additional overhead. \r\n\r\nAn important issue in the development of PP frameworks is scalability of AABI algorithms for large models and large data sets. One solution approach concerns message passing-based inference in factor graphs. In this framework, relationships between model variables are represented by a graph of sparsely connected nodes, and inference proceeds efficiently by a sequence of nodes sending probabilistic messages to neighboring nodes. While the optimal message passing schedule is data-dependent, all existing factor graph frameworks  (e.g., Infer.Net, ForneyLab.jl) use preset message sequence schedules. The potential benefits of massively parallel and asynchronous reactive message passing in a factor graph include scaling to large inference tasks, much smaller processing latency and processing of data samples that arrive at irregular time intervals. \r\n\r\nWe have developed ReactiveMP.jl, which is a native Julia package for automated reactive message passing-based (both exact and approximate) Bayesian inference. ReactiveMP.jl is based on Rocket.jl, which is a native Julia package for a reactive programming. In ReactiveMP.jl, there are no pre-scheduled messages. Instead, nodes subscribe to messages from connected nodes and react autonomously and asynchronously whenever a new message has been received. As a result, ReactiveMP.jl scales comfortably to inference tasks on factor graphs with tens of thousands of variables and millions of nodes.\r\n\r\nThe ReactiveMP.jl package comes with a collection of standard probabilistic models, including linear Gaussian state-space models, hidden Markov models, auto-regressive models and mixture models. Moreover, ReactiveMP.jl API supports various processing modes such as offline learning, online filtering of infinite data streams and protocols for handling missing data.\r\n\r\nReactiveMP.jl is customizable and provides an easy way to add new models, node functions and analytical message update rules to the existing platform. As a result, a user can extend built-in functionality with custom nodes to run automated inference in novel probabilistic models. The resulting inference procedures are differentiable with the ForwardDiff.jl or ReverseDiff.jl packages. In addition, the inference engine supports different types of floating point numbers, e.g., the built-in BigFloat Julia type.\r\n\r\nWe achieved excellent performance by relying on Julia's great multiple dispatch capabilities and advanced compile-time optimization techniques. Message passing-based inference requires computation of many messages by node-specific update rules. Some of these updates can be evaluated and in-lined at compile time, which results in a fast and accurate automated Bayesian inference realization with almost zero overhead when compared to manually hard-coded inference procedures. \r\n\r\nWe compared ReactiveMP.jl to other message passing and sampling-based inference packages. In terms of computation time and memory usage, specifically for conjugate models, the ReactiveMP.jl engine outperforms Turing.jl, ForneyLab.jl and Infer.Net significantly by orders of magnitude. Comparative performance benchmarks are available at the GitHub repository: https://github.com/biaslab/ReactiveMP.jl.\r\n\r\nAutomating scalable Bayesian inference is a key factor in the quest to apply Bayesian machine learning to useful applications. We developed ReactiveMP.jl as a package that enables developers to build novel probabilistic models and automate scalable inference in those models by asynchronous, reactive message passing in a factor graph. We are looking forward to presenting the ReactiveMP.jl package and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the reactive message passing approach.",

  "description": "Fourier space is commonly used for convolution operations, as the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) is, as its name may suggest, O(N log N) fast. The FFT algorithm typically produces data at a mangled form that makes it difficult to directly apply functions to. `fftshift` is a way to deal with this but involves data copies. \r\nBased on the packages ShiftedArrays.jl and PaddedViews.jl, the FourierTools.jl package implements views to the results of the FFTW routines `fft` and `rfft` and their inverse `ifft` and `irfft` including the respective `fftshift` operations but implemented as views rather than copying data. The indexing is, in notable difference to FFTViews.jl kept as ordinary arrays are indexed. This helps with the seamless integration across packages. \r\nTo implement an FFT-based `resample` operation of real-valued data, a new view, derived from `AbstractArray` is introduced, handling potential copy and addition operations for even-sized arrays to enforce the real-valuedness of the corresponding real space data (`select_region_ft`). In the community it has been [discussed](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/sinc-interpolation-based-on-fft/52512), whether such an operation is necessary. Referring to this discussion, we argue that the Fourier-space operations cannot be replaced by casting to `real`, since the latter violates Parseval's theorem. \r\nIn addition to the `resample` operation `FourierTools.jl` also provides a tool for sub-pixel shifting based FFTs. Further algorithms like shearing, sub-pixel shifting and rotation can be also implemented via the use of the Fourier shift theorem and due to the generality of the FFT these can be applied to N-dimensional datasets efficiently.",

  "description": "For both military and civilian purposes, the assessment of the impact of a CBRN agent release is crucial. To assess the area of contamination of an agent, atmospheric dispersion models can be used. The accuracy of such models particularly depends on high quality weather data. A joint project of Royal Military Academy of Belgium, ECMWF and Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium aims to develop a web application that implements simple dispersion models with real-time weather forecast data from ECMWF. The idea is to provide quick assessments of the impact area of a CRBN release as well as response models to plan appropriate actions. The application will run on the ECMWF Weather Cloud so the input weather data for the models can be accessed quickly.\r\nA prototype of the application has already been developed. For the time being, it implements the very simple ATP-45 dispersion model from NATO, which basically draws various hazard area shapes on the map according to the wind speed at the release location. Some screenshots of the app are provided in attachment.\r\nThe more complex FLEXPART atmospheric model is currently being added to the application and other state-of-the-art models are foreseen to be implemented as well. The response model will also be added using event driven simulation to account for other external data (population density, topography etc.). Ultimately, it will be possible to use ensemble forecast data to produce ensemble dispersion modelling and introduce probabilistic quantification in the response model.\r\nThe choice of Julia for the implementation has been made because we want to use the SimJulia.jl package, maintained by Ben Lauwens and who is one of the supervisors of the project. We are currently using the Genie.jl web framework as backend for web development (Angular is used as frontend) and some other packages for the handling of meteorological data (GRIB.jl, packages from JuliaGeo...).\r\nThe presentation will cover:\r\n- A general description of the project\r\n- A live demo of the application\r\n- An Explanation about the role of Julia in the application\r\n- The future of the project",

  "description": "Julia has been touted as a great solution to the two-language problem (and it is).  But for many, interacting with code in other languages is a necessity.\r\n\r\nNumerous packages exist which aid interoperability with other languages, including C ([`Clang.jl`](https://juliainterop.github.io/Clang.jl/stable/)), C++ ([`CxxWrap.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/CxxWrap.jl)), Java ([`JavaCall.jl`](https://juliainterop.github.io/JavaCall.jl/)), Matlab ([`Matlab.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/MATLAB.jl) / [`Mex.jl`](https://github.com/byuflowlab/Mex.jl)), Python ([`PyCall.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl) / [`pyjulia`](https://pyjulia.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)), R ([`RCall.jl`](https://juliainterop.github.io/RCall.jl/stable/) / [`JuliaCall`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/JuliaCall/readme/README.html)), Mathematica ([`MathLink.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/MathLink.jl)), and rust ([`jlrs`](https://docs.rs/jlrs/0.9.0/jlrs/)). \r\n\r\nMany of these packages focus on calling out to code in other languages from Julia, but there is also support for calling Julia code from other languages, especially for those that have the ability to call C functions, and that is what we will focus on here.\r\n\r\nThe Julia manual has a [full section on Embedding Julia](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/embedding/).  Until now, this has been the standard way to embed and call Julia from other languages.  Using the ideas here, along with custom Julia sysimage generation with [`PackageCompiler.jl`](https://julialang.github.io/PackageCompiler.jl/dev/), one of us created a proof-of-concept repository for creating a shared library from Julia code for C or other languages (https://github.com/simonbyrne/libcg).\r\n\r\nOne downside of this work is that the library was not easy to relocate--it contained hard-coded paths to the Julia runtime.  We wanted the ability to create a relocatable shared library.\r\n\r\n`PackageCompiler.jl` already allowed the creation of “apps”--bundles of files, including an executable--which could be relocated and moved to other machines (with some minor caveats).  We extended this functionality to create relocatable shared libraries with a `create_library` function.\r\n\r\nThe actual act of creating a shared library with `PackageCompiler.jl` is very much like creating an “app”, and has a very similar output--a bundle of directories which include the shared library and enough of the Julia runtime to run.  This bundle can be zipped or tarred up, sent to other computers, and installed in any location that a linker can find it.  The user has the option of setting the library version (on Mac and Linux), and can include C header files for the Julia functions she has exported in the shared library.\r\n\r\nFor this talk, we will give a brief overview of the `create_library` functionality, discuss situations in which it might be used, show how to use it, and discuss its limitations.",

In particular we will use DFTK to inspect what's going on while the  DFT problem is being solved. With that knowledge at hand we'll try to code up some simple DFT solvers on our own. Due to  the scaffolding DFTK provides this is a fairly manageable task and (as a small bonus) the resulting algorithms could be directly applied to cutting edge problems (if we're careful with performance issues).\r\n\r\nDepending on how our progress is I plan to cover the following topics:\r\n  - Problem setup: Mathematical structure of DFT \r\n  - Typical discretisation approaches: Gaussians versus plane waves\r\n  - Typical solution algorithms: Direct minimisation versus self-consistent field (SCF) iterations\r\n  - Numerical analysis of SCF problems\r\n  - Writing our own SCF, understanding why it badly fails and what we can do about it. \r\n  - Connections between the physical properties of matter and convergence properties of an SCF\r\n\r\n### Assumed background\r\nI'll try to do my best to make this workshop accessible for a broad range of people: Those with the chemistry or physics background that always wanted to understand the maths behind DFT as well as those with the understanding on PDEs / linear algebra that are interested in getting an idea about this challenging application domain.\r\n\r\nI will assume you safely know your way around Julia.",

Use of these tools range from granting parole, shortlisting job applications to accepting credit applications. There have been numerous political and policy developments during the past one year that have pointed out the transparency issues and bias in these ML based decision support tools. Thus it has become crucial for the ML community to think about fairness and bias. Eliminating bias  isn't easy due to the existence of various trade-offs. There exist various performance-fairness, fairness-fairness (various definitions of fairness might not be compatible) trade-offs.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we shall we shall discuss\r\n- Challenges in mitigating bias\r\n- Metrics and fairness algorithms offered by Fairness.jl and the workflow with the package\r\n- How Julia's ecosystem of packages (MLJ, Distributed) helped us in performing a large systematic benchmarking of debiasing algorithms, which helped us understand their [generalization properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02407).\r\n\r\nRepository: [Fairness.jl](https://github.com/ashryaagr/Fairness.jl)\r\n\r\nDocumentation is available [here](https://ashryaagr.github.io/Fairness.jl/dev/), and introductory blogpost is available [here](https://nextjournal.com/ashryaagr/fairness/)",

Here I will focus on nonlinear dynamics, a discipline that suffers greatly from the disconnect between the mathematics and the coding. In fact, this disconnect is largely what started the JuliaDynamics software organization, as a means to eliminate this disconnect.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will present the numerous ways that we have employed in order to fundamentally change physics education for the better. And this change necessarily requires including coding as part of the learning subject. I will demonstrate how we created easy to read code using Julia, how to incorporate it into exercises, how to make interactive applications that enhance learning, and how to include scientific analysis using code as part of the learning subject. Our new approach to teaching nonlinear dynamics, which I will present here, is also published as a new textbook on the topic by Springer. The book explicitly includes real, runnable Julia code. A GitHub repository related with the book can be found here: https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/NonlinearDynamicsTextbook\r\n\r\nI believe that this new approach should be used by more and more branches of physics. When this is done, then finally coding will be viewed as an integral part of science, instead of some \"background business behind the curtains\", which is its current perception. Ultimately, this will lead not only to better science, but to actually reproducible science.",

  "description": "Quantum nonlocality is one of the most puzzling phenomena of the physical world.  Physicists such as Albert Einstein were deeply unsettled by the quantum mechanical prediction that distant regions of spacetime can be correlated beyond what is physically allowed by causality and determinism. In recent years, the existence of quantum nonlocality has been proven beyond reasonable doubt, and a myriad of technological advantages in information security and distributed computation result from this fascinating physical phenomenon.\r\n\r\nTo help understand quantum nonlocality and harness its technological advantages, I’ve developed the BellScenario.jl package. This open-source Julia package computes the bounds of classical physics, and more importantly, establishes the quantum parameters at which nonlocality arises. The computational task at hand is daunting, however, the Julia ecosystem facilitates the  amalgamation of disparate computational tools allowing meaningful results to be procured. More specifically, BellScenario.jl  brings together the polyhedral computations of Polyhedra.jl, the convex optimization of Convex.jl and JuMP.jl,  and state of the art techniques for polyhedral decomposition  and quantum  optimization. A possibility which is easily realized within the Julia ecosystem.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will cover the basics of quantum nonlocality, its applications, and the computational problems involved. Then, I will present how I leverage the Julia ecosystem to make this quantum nonlocality research tangible, transparent,  and reproducible. In a broader scope, BellScenario.jl serves as an essential component of a rapidly developing ecosystem of Julia tools geared towards quantum information. This  talk will be of interest to the growing number of quantum information researchers, and its foundational concepts will entertain any scientific thinker with an ear towards quantum quandaries and their philosophical implications.",

This enables us to eliminate one of the main performance bottlenecks under memory-bound situation. We present ExaTron.jl's architecture, its kernel design principles, and implementation details with experimental results comparing different design choices.

These two-part puzzles start with basic programming concepts, and ramp up in difficulty over the course of the month. Although there is a competitive aspect to solving each puzzle before the other 100,000 participants, people from all sorts of backgrounds join for all sorts of reasons.\r\n\r\nI wrote my first lines of Julia code to solve Day 1 of Advent of Code 2020. I shared my solutions on Twitter, and discovered the Julia community is quick to provide encouragement, and happy to give constructive feedback appropriate to your level of familiarity with the language! As the event continued, my favorite part of the day quickly became checking in to see how others in the Julia community solved that day's problem. On some days, I learned something new and was able to improve on my own approach. On other days, I discovered I'd tackled the challenge the same way as experienced Julia users, instilling me with confidence in my new-found abilities.",

  "description": "## [ZigZagBoomerang.jl](https://github.com/mschauer/ZigZagBoomerang.jl) - parallel inference and variable selection\r\n\r\nZigZagBoomerang.jl provides piecewise deterministic Monte Carlo (PDMC) methods. They have the same goal as classical Markov chain Monte Carlo methods: to sample from a probability distribution, for example the posterior distribution in a Bayesian model. Only that the distribution is explored through the continuous movement of a particle and not one point at a time. The particle changes direction at random times and moves otherwise on deterministic trajectories. For example it may move with constant velocity along a line, see the picture. The random direction changes are calibrated such that the trajectory of the particle samples the target distribution, in general the particle is turned back (reflected) when moving too far into the tails of the distribution. From the trajectory, the quantities of interest, such as the posterior mean and standard deviation, can be estimated.\r\n\r\nThe decision of whether to change direction in one coordinate only requires the evaluation of a partial derivative which depends on few coordinates – the neighbourhood of the coordinate in the Markov blanket. That allows exploiting multiple processor cores using Julia's multithreaded parallelism (or other forms of parallel computing). The difference between threaded Gibbs sampling and threaded PDMP is that in Gibbs sampling part of the state is fixed, while the other part is changed. Here, the particle never ceases to move, and it is the decisions about direction changes which happen in parallel on subsets of coordinates. Metaphorically speaking this is the difference between walking, where one foot is on the ground all the time, and running, where both feet are in the air between steps. \r\n\r\nBecause the particle moves on a deterministic trajectory between the times of random events, one can determine exactly the time when the process would leave an area of interest. That allows to sample distributions of bounded support, or spending additional time in a lower dimensional subset of the space, the basis of variable selection with the sticky PDMPs in high dimensional sparse inference problems.\r\n\r\nIn the presentation I showcase a multithreaded sampler and high-dimensional variable selection with sticky PDMPs.\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n\r\n* [ZigZagBoomerang.jl](https://github.com/mschauer/ZigZagBoomerang.jl)\r\n* Discourse Announcement: [[ANN] `ZigZagBoomerang.jl`](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/ann-zigzagboomerang-jl/57287) \r\n* Joris Bierken's [Overview over Piecewise Deterministic Monte Carlo](https://diamweb.ewi.tudelft.nl/~joris/pdmps.html)\r\n\r\n### Literature\r\n\r\n1.

  "description": "Automatic differentiation (AD), the ability to efficiently evaluate derivatives of arbitrary functions without computing derivatives by hand, enables efficient learning of many mathematical models. There are two components to every AD system: a collection of primitives (also called sensitivities or adjoints), and a way to keep track of and combine primitives using the chain rule of calculus in order to compute derivatives of arbitrary functions. While AD systems differ greatly in the latter, the set of primitives can be shared among them.\r\n\r\nThe ChainRules ecosystem provides the AD-independent collection of primitives for Julia Base (ChainRules.jl), utilities for defining custom primitives (ChainRulesCore.jl), and utilities for testing custom primitives using finite differences (ChainRulesTestUtils.jl). While not needed in principle, the ability to define custom primitives provides a way to speed up the computation by applying domain knowledge or mathematical insight, or get around limitations and performance issues of individual AD systems. In addition, ChainRulesCore.jl provides a suite of expressive differential types which allow comparing derivatives across multiple AD systems.\r\n\r\nSince last year the ecosystem has matured considerably, improving the user experience in a number of ways. Improvements include:\r\n- It is now possible to write rules for higher order functions (e.g. map) by calling back into the AD system\r\n- @non_differentiable makes it easy to define rules for non-differentiable functions\r\n- Testing custom primitives became easier since a random tangent (usually) does not have to be provided\r\n- It is now possible to test f/rrule like functions, meaning AD systems can be tested\r\n- ChainRules is now used by Zygote, Nabla, ForwardDiff2, and ReversePropagation\r\n\r\nThis talk will start by briefly introducing the ChainRules ecosystem, and highlighting the most important new features since last year. Those unfamiliar with the general idea of ChainRules are encouraged to watch last year’s talk on ChainRules first, since the core of the talk is a comprehensive guide to using, writing, and testing custom primitives. In particular, the talk will explain when it is advantageous to write custom primitives compared to using an AD system on its own, the interface for writing custom primitives and the associated supporting functionality, as well as why and how to test primitives by finite differencing methods.",

  "description": "CovarianceFunctions.jl implements many commonly used kernel functions including stationary ones like the exponentiated quadratic, rational quadratic, and Matérn kernel, but also non-stationary ones like the polynomial and neural network kernel. A crucial component of the package is the \"Gramian\" matrix type which lazily represents kernel matrices with virtually no memory footprint. The package's most significant functionality derives from algorithms designed for particular combinations of kernel and data types, since they are able to drastically reduce the computational complexity of multiplication and inversion. However, even in the general case the lazy implementation eliminates the typical O(n^2) memory allocation for simply storing a kernel matrix of n data points\r\n\r\nFor stationary kernels in low dimensions, the package implements a new hierarchical factorization based on multipole expansions of the kernels via automatic differentiation. The user need only input the kernel function and data points, and the package automatically computes the relevant analytic expansions which are then leveraged within a treecode analagous to the Barnes-Hut algorithm. Fast multiplies are then performed in O(nlog(n)) time, and solves are performed using an iterative method whose preconditioner is also based on the aforementioned treecode.\r\n\r\nFor exponentially decaying stationary kernels (i.e. exponential, Matérn, RBF) in high dimensions, it is highly likely that the associated kernel matrix can be approximated well by a sparse matrix. However, naïvely detecting this approximate sparsity pattern would require evaluating the entire matrix in O(n^2) time. Instead, the package takes advantage of vantage trees to quickly find the most prominent neighbors of each data point in O(nk log(n)), where k is the maximum number of relevant neighbors of a data point.\r\n \r\nIn the context of Bayesian optimization with gradient information, the associated gradient kernel matrices are of size (nd x nd), naïvely requiring O(n^2d^2) operations for multiplication, which becomes prohibitive quickly as the number of parameters d increases. Based on recent work that uncovered a particular structure in a large class of these gradient kernel matrices, the package contains an exact multiplication algorithm that requires O(n^2d) operations. As a result, we are able to demonstrate first-order Bayesian optimization on problems of higher dimensionality than were previously possible.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any of the above particular structure, the package attempts to construct a low-rank approximation of the matrix via a generic pivoted Cholesky algorithm that lazily computes the kernel matrix's entries, allowing the algorithm to terminate in O(nr^2) steps, where r is the numerical rank, before even fully forming the entire matrix. In the worst case however, this falls back to O(n^3) complexity in the absence of any structure.\r\n\r\nIn addition to implementing the above algorithms, a main feature of the package is the automatic detection of the most scalable algorithm depending on the kernel and data type. We believe that this type of automation is particularly useful for practitioners that rely on kernel methods and need to scale them to large datasets. We further invite specialists to contribute their methods for efficient computations with kernel matrices.",

  "description": "The Forest Inventory is a name given to forest stand administration. It assesses changes in a forest, such as growth and development, and quantifies its total or commercial bulk. In the Forest Engineering course, it is one of the subjects of the greatest importance in the college curriculum. Most forest inventories are carried out by sampling, aimed to evaluate just one part of the stand that makes up the sample. They can be categorized into sampling techniques according to their periodicity, structure, and population approach. In this context, Julia Language is a promising programming software in the field of forest science because it is open access and high performance, faster to data analysis, easily learning, and has vast knowledge in other scientific and numerical computing systems. In this way, it will be able to process the data collected from the forest inventory with agility, saving time and costs. Thus, the project aims to develop a package contend the created functions about each sampling existing in the forest inventory with Julia Programming Language, intending to provide didactic materials, facilitating the process of teaching and learning of students and professional in the field which carry out processes sampling indispensable in the forest sector. In the development of the functions and creation of a package about the sampling processes in the forest inventory, the Julia programming language will be used, together with the Visual Studio Code source code interface. The basic aspects will be improved to make it easier for forest engineers to understand, taking into account that most are not specialists in the programming language. The creation of the programming package will be based on the sampling processes by researchers Sylvio Péllico Netto and Doádi Antônio Brena in the Forest Inventory book, 1997. In this sense, each process of sampling will be created with an individual function being they: simple random sampling, stratified sampling, systematic sampling, two-stage sampling, cluster sampling, systematic sampling with multiple random starts, and sampling on multiple occasions (independent sampling, with total repeat, double repeat, and partial repeat). To evaluate the use of the package created in Julia Language, tests will be carried out with students, and professionals from Forest Engineering. From the tests, it will be possible to evaluate the acceptance of the data processing package in the different sampling processes of the forest inventory.",

  "description": "Live streaming is a recent phenomena that has seen huge growth due to services such as Twitch, Youtube Live, and Facebook Live. Although this burgeoning community’s focus is generally on video games, vlogs, and talk shows, a niche that is increasing in this community are educational streams. Examples of such streams are where students studying invite audiences to “study with me” or educators hosting ask me anything sessions. In particular, one area in this niche that is particularly relevant for the Julia community is live coding.\r\n\r\nLive coding is where software developers or programmers stream their programming development to a live audience. It can take many shapes where a developer works on an open source project, a coder is learning a new language, or an interactive back-and-forth to create a novel application. Live coding works as a sort of give and take relationship where streamers get the opportunity to make new connections and the audience gets to be exposed to new programming styles or learn new skills. Often, this works in the reciprocal as well.\r\n\r\nFor the Julia community, with the advent of the COVID19 pandemic, many individuals were suddenly left in a common, but highly unusual, circumstance. As many have experienced and are experiencing, the days of being in a work office setting and having passing conversations with colleagues have become somewhat distant memories. Instead, many find themselves at home behind their computers with their only company being either family, pets, or the whir of their computer’s fan. In conjunction with this, the amount of interest in live streaming programming in the Julia community has been growing.\r\n\r\nIn this Birds of a Feather, we want to gather those people who have been live streaming within the Julia community and those interested in live streaming. In this gathering, streamers can share their ideas around best practices, tips and experiences in the streamer community. This could be a strong opportunity for the Julia community to also discuss how to reach and engage with people outside of the Julia community. Furthermore, this BoF could also lead to productive discussions on how to help within the Julia community whether that be in the form of increasing visibility to amazing Julia packages or leading teaching sessions. \r\n\r\nFinally, this BoF would also provide an open avenue for individuals who are interested in live streaming to freely ask questions. This could range from questions such as “what is needed to get started as a streamer?” to “how do you build a great community around your stream?” As a result, this can not only increase outreach from the Julia community but also foster new and meaningful connections one could make - especially in the pandemic era.",

  "description": "Tomographic imaging plays a major role in clinical routine and has revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of serious diseases such as stroke, heart attack and cancer. Tomographic techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography or the new imaging modality magnetic particle imaging (MPI) make it possible to look inside the human body without surgical intervention, simply by measuring indirect signals which allow reconstruction of an image of the inside of the body.  Medical imaging is an interdisciplinary field involving physicians, physicists, engineers, mathematicians and computer scientists to develop a tomographic imaging system. While the technical development of modalities such as MRI are approaching limits with respect to the optimization of signal quality, the potential on the side of image reconstruction algorithms has not yet been fully exploited. As a consequence, numerous innovations from the fields of mathematics, signal processing and computer science have found their way into tomography research within the last decade.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, algorithm development within the imaging community has been divided into two parts. Researchers who primarily work on mathematical methods often implement these using a high-level language such as Matlab and occasionally Python. As a result, the application of these algorithms is often limited to selected datasets, which validate the feasibility and the accuracy of the method. On the other hand, application-oriented researchers often use highly optimized program libraries, implemented in a low-level language such as C/C++, to apply algorithmic innovations to larger datasets that are acquired in clinical trials. Some of the larger C/C++ software packages such as the MRI reconstruction framework BART and Gadgetron use such a low-level approach and additionally provide Python bindings to make the framework accessible also to researchers who prefer using a high-level programming language. In practice, this hybrid approach, where low-level and high-level code is mixed leads to the well-known two-language problem since the presence of bindings still does not allow for an easy transition of new algorithmic ideas into the core of these packages.\r\n\r\nThis presentation of the current state of software tools in the imaging community shows that there is great potential for a modern programming language like Julia to close the gap between theoretically orientated and applied researchers.  The speaker of this talk will outline the Julia package infrastructure for two different imaging modalities that have been devel-oped since 2015. The packages cover a wide range of functionality, namely:\r\n\r\n- File handling for raw data files acquired with tomographic imaging systems. \r\n- Preprocessing of raw data to make it suitable for image reconstruction.\r\n- Routines for setting up dense and matrix-free image operators\r\n- Iterative solvers for solving the reconstruction problem, including a flexible system for applying regularization to incor-porate prior knowledge about the solution\r\n- Visualization methods for slicing, coloring, and merging tomographic images\r\n\r\nInstead of putting all of this functionality into a single software package, the opposite approach is taken with the philosophy of reusing as much functionality from existing Julia packages as possible (see attached figure). This has the advantage of keeping imaging-specific functionality small and allows to share common methods across different imaging modalities. Julia's powerful package manager allows for small packages, making this form of fine-granular modularization feasible. An interesting opportunity that arises by solving the two-language problem is that the software becomes much more accessible since a user can not only use the provided interface but also access internals easily. In the imaging packages MRIReco.jl and MPIReco.jl we have exploited this advantage by providing the user direct access to different abstraction layers of the reconstruction pipeline. In this way a user can either perform standard reconstruction using ready-to-use high-level building blocks or the user can develop a custom reconstruction pipeline based on the available building blocks. While this flexibility can also be achieved in two-language solutions, it arises very naturally in Julia, without much additional effort on the developer side.\r\n\r\nSince tomographic image reconstruction is a computationally intensive task one needs efficient algorithms to determine the image in short enough time. The talk outlines how the package MRIReco.jl has been designed to match the efficiency of a highly tuned C/C++ libraries even in a multi-threading scenario, based on the parallel task runtime support available since Julia 1.3.\r\n\r\nCore packages being presented: \r\n- https://github.com/MagneticResonanceImaging/MRIReco.jl\r\n- https://github.com/MagneticParticleImaging/MPIReco.jl",

  "description": "Chaoticity is by definition hard to predict or to reproduce using forecasting models. With the advent of Deep Learning (DL) a lot of effort has been dedicated to this problem, with the default approaches being represented by Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs). More recently a new family of models has proved more effective in tackling chaotic systems, namely Reservoir Computing (RC) models. Given the relative infancy of the RC paradigm it is not simple to find an implementation of such models, let alone a full library. With ReservorComputing.jl we want to propose a Julia package that allows the user to quickly get started with a fast growing range of RC models, ranging from the standard Echo State Networks (ESNs) to the more exotic Reservoir Computing with Cellular Automata (RECA). In this talk a brief introduction to the concept of RC will be given and afterwards the capabilities of ReservoirComputing.jl will be illustrated using interactive examples.\r\n\r\nReservoir Computing models work by expanding the input data into a higher dimensional space, called reservoir. After this expansion the resulting states are collected and the model is trained against the desired input as a linear regression problem. This approach allows for fast training times, and solves several problems of Neural Networks training, like the vanishing gradient. Not only are the models in the RC family faster and safer to train, but, as mentioned before, it has been shown that they are also better in the prediction and reproduction of chaotic systems. RC models are mainly composed of three sections: an input to reservoir coupler, the reservoir, and a reservoir to output coupler. The last section is the result of the training process, and is dependent on the training method that one chooses to utilize. It is easy to see that using different constructions for these elements is possible to obtain different results in the task at hand. To properly explore the RC models a quick way to access these layers is needed in their implementation. \r\n\r\nAt a high level, the implementation of ReservoirComputing.jl gives the user the appropriate tools needed for a quick setup of the desired model, allowing an exploration of these family of models for the prediction of a given time series. Otherwise if one chooses to delve more deeply into the customization of the model, the implementation of ReservoirComputing.jl follows a modularity designed to leave users with the freedom to fully customize the system they intend to train and use for predictions. This not only helps with possible recombinations of layers already implemented in the library, but allows for expansions with the aid of external libraries or custom code. Leveraging the great package ecosystem of Julia the user could decide to train the RC system using not yet implemented regression approaches with an external package. At the same time it is possible to use a reservoir matrix construction not present in the library, either by custom construction, or again by using other packages, like LightGraphs.jl. \r\n\r\nAfter the brief introduction of the RC paradigm the talk intends to illustrate the concepts defined above using concrete examples. It will be shown both the ease of use of the package and some of the possible variations included that can be explored. Finally a demonstration of possible customizations will be illustrated, both by custom defined layers and by leveraging other libraries of the Julia ecosystem.",

  "description": "Deepmind's AlphaZero algorithm illustrates a general methodology of combining learning and search to solve complex combinatorial problems. Yet, despite its much-publicized success at the game of Go and a wide range of potential applications, few researchers have managed to build on it.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to make AlphaZero widely accessible to students and researchers, we introduce [AlphaZero.jl](https://github.com/jonathan-laurent/AlphaZero.jl).

Then, we introduce our [AlphaZero.jl](https://github.com/jonathan-laurent/AlphaZero.jl) package. We show how Julia enables a unique combination of simplicity, flexibility and speed, while also identifying areas in which improvements to the Julia ecosystem could lead to further performance gains. We conclude the talk with more general thoughts on how we believe Julia can have a transformative impact on reinforcement-learning research.",

  "description": "It can be hard to build and solve million equation models. Making them high performance, stable, and parallel? Introducing ModelingToolkit.jl! In this workshop we will showcase ModelingToolkit as a system for building large differential equation models in a hierarchical component-wise way. This acausal modeling system is reminiscent of widely used tools like Simulink and Modelica, but we will showcase how ModelingToolkit's deep integration with interactive symbolic programming leads to a more intuitive pure Julia modeling system. The audience will be walked through a live demonstration of using ModelingToolkit to compose models and add transformations, like index reduction of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) and tearing of nonlinear systems, to improve stability and performance of the generated code. We will demonstrate how to use the automated parallelism easily solve millions of equations in the most performant way. We will show how ModelingToolkit extends far beyond differential equations, featuring how it can be used for similarly generating high performance code for nonlinear optimization, solving nonlinear equations, doing nonlinear optimal control, generating models from chemical reaction descriptions, and more. The user will leave with a better understanding of the growing symbolic-numeric modeling ecosystem and the future of large-scale accurate and high-performance SciML modeling.",

We are the developers of one such tool: [Ahorn](https://github.com/CelestialCartographers/Ahorn) is a graphical level editor for the video game Celeste that allows a user to create their own levels for the game. Ahorn is written entirely in Julia. As the tool itself is likely to be of little interest to the Julia community, this talk will not focus on the tool, but on our experiences developing and deploying it.\r\nOwing to the nature of the tool, its audience consists in large parts of people who want to dip their toes in game and level design for the first time. Many of these people are young, some as young as 13 years old. This talk will be about what it is like to develop a graphical Julia application that has to be able to be installed by a child on a 10-year-old laptop. What did the Julia ecosystem offer for GUI design in early 2018 when the project started? How well did Julia’s package installation system handle the large variety in hardware and operating systems we have encountered? How has the situation improved since then? What unique features does Julia offer that made us choose it, and how did using the language pay off years later? In our talk, we would like to answer these questions by sharing on our own experiences, and provide some ideas for what can be improved if the Julia community wants the language to become more widely adopted for the development of non-scientific user-facing applications.",

This data can be subsequently utilized to extract information about city’s POIs (points of interest), measure actual distances, perform routing and build numerical simulation model that make it possible to understand dynamics of a city. Those capabilities will be illustrated with a map of Toronto and show how to extend the osm data with other sources to extend the city routing beyond cars and sidewalks and model an actual public transportation network. \r\n\r\nIn this presentation two interconnected applications of the The OpenStreetMapX.jl package will be presented. Firstly, mixed routing combining different means of transportation will be presented and discussed showing how different Julia libraries can work together towards a common goal (including [OpenStreetMapXPlot](https://github.com/pszufe/OpenStreetMapX.jl), [LightGraphs](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl),  PyCall, Plots, DataFrames and others). Secondly, an agent-based simulation of a public transportation system will be discussed. We will show how to model and measure the impact of availability and frequency of public transportation onto decisions made by commuters and subsequently its contribution towards spreading the pandemic. \r\n\r\nThe presentation is accompanied by a Jupyter notebook that is available since on the [OpenStreetMapX.jl GitHub project website](https://github.com/pszufe/OpenStreetMapX.jl) since the first day of JuliaCon 2021. \r\n\r\nIn summary, in this talk the following areas will be discussed:\r\n\r\n-\tprocessing of OpenStreetMap data in Julia to obtain graph structures for processing with LightGraphs.jl\r\n-\tvisualizing graphs, maps and spatial data with OpenStreetMapXPlot.jl (GR, PyPlot backends) as well as integration with Leaflet via folium and PyCall\r\n-\tbuilding animations of a city using OpenStreetMapXPlot.jl combined with the `Plots.@animate` macro \r\n-\tusing Julia to augment OSM map data with external sources in order to build routing mechanism that can include public transportation (metro, streetcarts)\r\n-\tcombine this all into an agent simulation that can be used to model how the frequency and availability of a public urban transportation system contributes to the development of pandemic \r\n\r\n*The research is financed by a NSERC, Canada, “Alliance COVID-19” grant titled: \"COVID-19: Agent-based framework for modelling pandemics in urban environment”.*",

  "description": "Any practicing data scientist can tell you that all the munging going on between data acquisition and mathematical algorithm is a huge time sink. This is especially evident when the data does not fall into the traditional model of the dataframe. If one is lucky, it is shaped like a graph, and one can use a graph data structure and graph algorithms to analyze it. However, more generally, there are many more \"shapes\" of data, that must either be put into adhoc data structures or shoehorned into general-purpose data structures.\r\n\r\nIn Catlab, we have built a general infrastructure for differently-shaped data based on a category-theoretic framework for databases as functors that we call \"Attributed C-Sets\" (acsets for short).\r\n\r\nThe acset infrastructure is made possible by a novel use of the Julia macro and type system, which would be difficult-to-untenable in most other languages. First \"schemas\" for acsets are generated by macros. Then, more macros are used to transform these schemas into custom structs. Finally, we use `@generated` functions to specialize generic operations to these custom structs.\r\n\r\nThis approach gives us performance comparable to popular data solutions like DataFrames.jl and LightGraphs.jl, while remaining fully generic. The acset infrastructure is used pervasively throughout the AlgebraicJulia ecosystem because of the flexibility, expressivity, and performance features.\r\n\r\nIn our talk, we will give an overview of the mathematical and computational innovations necessary to implement the acset infrastructure, as well as examples of practical applications of acsets, and a reflection on how acsets have become an essential part of AlgebraicJulia.",

  "description": "_AtomicSets.jl was developed by Michael Friedlander, Zhenan Fan and Mia Kramer at the University of British Columbia._\r\n\r\nWe say a set is convex if, for every pair of points in the set, the line between those points is also contained in the set. This is a generalization of the notion of convex that most of us would have learned in grade school for polygons: the set doesn't have any \"caves\" or \"dents\". We similarly call a function convex if its _epigraph_—the set of points \"above\" the function if it were plotted—is convex. Some common examples of useful convex sets are the _one ball_—the set of all points with 1-norm less than or equal to one, and the _nuclear ball_—the set of all matrices that can be written as an outer product of unit norm vectors. We care about convexity because it guarantees some useful properties for optimization. For exampe: any local minimum of a convex function is also a global minimum. Combinations of these properties can give us efficient algorithms with strong convergence guarantees.\r\n\r\nSuppose we are trying to solve a problem where our answer is a vector, and we expect it to be sparse. In general, computing with exact sparsity is difficult, but let's take a step back. To say that a vector is sparse is to say it should be constructed from a small number of coordinate vectors, each scaled by a nonnegative amount. Let's take the coordinate vectors (and their opposite sign counterparts) to be our _atoms_, and take their convex hull to be our domain. We now have a domain we know to be convex, which also induces the structure we want to see in our solution. The process is similar for low-rank matrices: we assume that they will be constructed from a small number of outer products, so we take the set of unit rank outer products to be our atoms.\r\n\r\nTo generalize over these _atomic sets_, we need more than their common properties; we need a set of common operations. The most basic of these is probably the `gauge` function. Given a set _A_ and a point _x_, the gauge function answers the question \"what is the smallest scale _λ_ such that _x_ is in _λ A_?\" In other words, how much do we have to expand or contract _A_ so that _x_ is only just contained in it? If we pick our set to be the _two ball_, the set of points with Euclidean norm ≤ 1, our gauge function is just the Euclidean norm of the point.\r\n\r\nOther common operations we have on atomic sets are the `expose` and `support` functions. The `expose` function gives us the atom which is most aligned with a given vector, where aligned means maximizing the dot product. Another way to imagine the operation is to take your set and your vector, and then sweep a hyperplane from the origin in the direction of the vector. The last point that the hyperplane touches on its path is the exposed point. The `support` function gives the value of the inner product which produced the exposed point.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we define a calculus of atomic sets. We can construct atomic sets that are, for example, the Minkowski sum of other sets, a scaling of a set, or a linear map applied on a set. The `expose` operation gives us in some sense an element of the subderivative of the set, and so the usual chain rule applies. By defining this operation recursively for these compound sets, they too can be generic.\r\n\r\nUsing Julia's type system, we build representations for the sets, their atoms, and _faces_ (collections of atoms). By writing functions using these common operations on atomic sets, Julia's dispatch system allows compiling said function for any choice of atomic set (and hence notion of sparsity). Using this construction, we present a dual method for solving min_x ½ ‖ Mx - b ‖² s.t. gauge_A(x) ≤ τ, which is generic over the choice of set _A_.",

  "description": "This talk walks over our recent experiences in our development efforts. The parallel layout of GPUs requires running as many operations as possible in batch mode, in a massively parallel fashion. We will detail how we have adapted the automatic differentiation, the linear algebra and the optimization solvers in a batch setting and present the different challenges we have addressed. Our efforts have led to the development of different prototypes, all addressing a specific issue on the GPU: ExaPF for batch automatic differentiation, ExaTron as a batch optimization solver, ProxAL for distributed parallelism. The future research opportunities are manyfold for the nonlinear optimization community: how can we leverage new automatic differentiation backends developed in the machine learning community for optimization purpose? How can we exploit the Julia language to develop a vectorized nonlinear optimization modeler targeting massively parallel accelerators?",

However, these simulators are not generally amenable to Bayesian inference, as they do not provide likelihoods for execution traces, support constraining of observed random variables, or allow random choices and subroutines to be selectively updated in Monte Carlo algorithms.\r\n\r\nTo address these limitations, we present Genify.jl, an approach to transforming plain Julia code into generative functions in Gen, a universal probabilistic programming system with programmable inference. We accomplish this via lightweight transformation of lowered Julia code into Gen’s dynamic modeling language, combined with a user-friendly random variable addressing scheme that enables straightforward implementation of custom inference programs.\r\n\r\nWe demonstrate the utility of this approach by transforming an existing agent-based simulator from plain Julia into Gen, and designing custom inference programs that increase accuracy and efficiency relative to generic SMC and MCMC methods.

  "description": "High performance computing (HPC) has enabled predictive simulation models that have revolutionized physics, chemistry, biology, and other sciences. Modern supercomputers with exascale performance (one billion billion calculations per second) will create massive new quantities of simulation data. Saving this data has become a computational bottleneck: because storage is much slower than processors, only a tiny fraction of data generated by an exascale simulation can be saved to disk for later statistical analysis. Larger supercomputers will simulate physical systems with unprecedented detail, opening new avenues for scientific advancement, but as computational speed increases, a decreasing fraction of simulation data can be analyzed, limiting the scientific gains that can be realized.\r\nIn response to this barrier, “in-situ” approaches have emerged to analyze data within the simulation itself, as the data are being generated, without needing to first save them to disk. Most of these approaches focus on compressing data by extracting scientifically informative features, such as the locations of interesting events within the simulation. However, they do not address the broader problem of inference: fitting statistical models, such as large-scale regressions, to spatial and time series data. A large body of advanced statistical analysis techniques therefore cannot be applied to exascale simulation data.\r\nWe have begun developing the algorithms and software tools to fit sophisticated statistical models in-situ. We are using Julia to implement new statistical algorithms that can analyze scientific data efficiently on exascale supercomputers, dealing with unique computational challenges presented by in-situ analysis. These challenges include distributing the calculation of data correlations in parallel across many computational nodes while minimizing slow inter-node communication; analyzing data one piece at a time when they are too large to hold in memory at once; and constructing faster algorithms to fit statistical models that will not slow down the simulation while analysis\r\noccurs. We are applying these new analysis techniques in the context of modeling extreme events in climate and space weather simulations.\r\nOur project’s primary deliverable is the Programming Repository for In Situ Modeling (PRISM). PRISM is a set of tools for fitting statistics and machine learning models to simulation data inside the simulations as they are running. The tools are designed to implement a wide variety of data analyses with an emphasis on spatiotemporal hierarchical Bayesian models. PRISM is intended to be efficient, scalable, and streaming with estimation based on variational inference, advanced Monte Carlo techniques, and fast optimization methods. The core modeling components aid this goal by imposing sparsity and approximate inference wherever possible. All of these components are being written in Julia to enable data scientists to write code in a high-level programming language that is performant enough to keep up with the C/C++ and Fortran codes it will be embedded within. PRISM also contains tools for interfacing with large-scale scientific simulations written in Fortran and C/C++. This layer of abstraction allows the data scientist to construct analysis models in Julia without concern for the implementation details of the simulation capability. With these components, PRISM can be used to unlock the full scientific potential of next-generation HPC simulations.\r\nThus far, we have implemented methods for distributed sparse Gaussian processes, Gaussian mixture modeling for clustering, and extreme value modeling. We have also implemented fast estimation techniques based on sequential variational inference (an approximation scheme for estimating Bayesian posterior distribution) and deep neural networks to optimize parameters of Gaussian process models. This work also includes domain-specific analyses for the detection of sudden stratospheric warming in a climate simulation and the identification of fast plasma flow channels in a space weather simulation. These techniques have been demonstrated on high-performance computing hardware at Los Alamos National Laboratory.",

  "description": "The alignment of two or more biological sequences is one of the main workhorses in bioinformatics because it can quantify similarity and reveal conserved patterns. Dynamic programming allows for rapidly computing the optimal alignment between two sequences by recursively splitting the problem into smaller tractable choices, i.e., deciding whether it is best to extend a current alignment or introduce a gap in one of the sequences. This process leads to the optimal alignment score and backtracking yields the optimal alignment. By departing from a collection of pairwise alignments, one can heuristically compute a multiple sequence alignment of many sequences. If one is interested in the effect of a small change in the alignment parameter or the sequences, one has to compute the alignment score gradient with respect to these inputs. Regrettably, computing this gradient is not possible because the individual maximisation (minimisation) steps in the dynamic programming are non-differentiable.\r\n\r\nHowever, Mensch and Blondel recently showed that by smoothing the maximum operator, for example, by regularising with an entropic term, one can design fully differentiable dynamic programming algorithms. The individual smoothed maximum operators have various desirable properties, such as being efficient to compute, sparsity, or probabilistic interpretation. Departing from this work, we created a differentiable version of the Needleman–Wunsch and Smith-Waterman algorithm. Using ChainRulesCore.jl, we allowed this gradient to be compatible with Julia's autodiff ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThe resulting gradient has an immediate diagnostic and statistical interpretation, such as computing the Fisher information to create uncertainty estimates. Furthermore, it enables us to use sequence alignment in differentiable computing, allowing one to learn an optimal substitution matrix and gap cost from a set of homologous sequences. The flexibility allows these parameters to vary at different regions in the sequences, for example, depending on the secondary structure. One can also change this around and fix the alignment parameters and optimise the sequences for alignment. This scheme allows for finding consensus sequences, which can be useful in creating a multiple sequence alignment. More broadly, our algorithm can be incorporated in arbitrary artificial neural network architectures (using e.g. Flux.jl), making it an attractive alternative to the popular convolution neural networks, LSTMs or transformer networks currently used to learn from biological sequences.",

  "description": "The primary motivations for implementing BLAS/LAPACK in Julia are:\r\n1. Because we can!\r\n2. The existence of highly optimized alternatives such as MKL provide a solid benchmark by which to assess how we're doing before applying the same optimization approaches to novel problems.\r\n3. We can adapt the routines easily to related operation types such as evaluating dense layers or miscellaneous tensor operations.\r\n4. Generic with respect to number types, whether that means mixing precision or something as exotic as Tropical Numbers (showcased in TropicalGEMM.jl).\r\n5. Ability to take advantage of compile time information and specialize, e.g. for statically sized arrays.\r\n6. Relatively painless support for new hardware, as we do not need to write assembly kernels. Feature detection and support for generating optimized code will also be tied with LLVM rather than libraries like OpenBLAS, which tend to lag far behind the compilers.\r\n\r\nSome of the challenges faced in the ecosystem include:\r\n1. Efficient composable threading with low enough overhead to beat MKL for small array sizes.\r\n2. Compilation time or sysimage building to avoid \"time to first matmul\" problems.\r\n3. The implementations of BLAS and LAPACK routines themselves.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, BLAS and LAPACK libraries define many compute kernels, typically written in assembly for each supported architecture. Supporting code then builds the supported BLAS and LAPACK routines through applying these kernels.\r\n\r\nLibraries such as  Octavian and RecursiveFactorization followed this approach while using LoopVectorization to produce most of the kernels.\r\nAn alternative approach is to use these problems to motivate and guide extending LoopVectorization to perform analysis and optimizations.\r\nAt the time I submit this proposal, planned features that will be able to extend the amount of work LoopVectorization can handle automatically, thereby reducing the effort needed to implement new functions:\r\n1. Allowing the bounds of inner loops to depend on the induction variables of outer loops. For example, loops of the form`for m in 1:M, n in 1:m; ...; end`.\r\n2. Allow multiple loops to occur at the same level in the nest. For example, loops of the form `for m in 1:M; for n in 1:N; end; for k in 1:K; end; end`.\r\n3. Model dependencies across loop iterations, and avoid violating them. For example, loops of the form `for m in 1:M; a[m] += a[m-1]; end`.\r\n\r\nTogether, these would allow LoopVectorization to support loop nests performing cholesky factorizations or triangular solves. These should be tunable to perform with (nearly) optimal performance at small to moderate sizes for use in blockwise routines.\r\n\r\nAn orthogonal set of optimizations would be to develop a model for automatically generating blocking (working on pieces of arrays at a time that fit nicely into upper cache levels) and packing code (copying pieces of arrays into temporary buffers to avoid pessimized address calculations due to memory accesses being spread across too many pages; this also benefits hardware prefetchers, which require relatively small strides between subsequent memory accesses to trigger).\r\n\r\nWe outline a path toward building up an ecosystem through a combination of the approaches, including applications we can target -- such as stiff ODE solves benefiting from LU and triangular solves -- and see immediately benefits along the way.",

  "description": "Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) is a very promising and exciting field that has been emerging in the past few years, with particular strength within the Julia community given the thriving SciML ecosystem. It consists of a growing set of diverse tools focused on combining traditional scientific modeling with novel machine learning (ML) techniques. The former is usually based on the long-established field of differential equations (DE) models, while the latter,  though more recent, provides powerful general-purpose tools, and has demonstrated remarkable achievements in many applications.\r\n\r\nBoth approaches, of course, have their advantages and drawbacks: traditional modeling is far from trivial, since building an adequate model for a given problem usually requires educated guesses and approximations based on a deep understanding of the system being studied. Often in practice, it is only possible to build partial models and have access only to an incomplete set of the considered variables, sometimes even in a different unknown coordinate system. On the other hand, using orthodox ML models on poor-quality and scarce scientific data can be disadvantageous because of the lack of interpretability of these models, and the dependence on large amounts of training data to achieve good generalization. \r\n\r\nSciML is a bridge between these two worlds, taking the best from each. A perfect example of such hybrid solutions is the case of Universal Differential Equations [1], where prior scientific insight is used to build some parts of a DE model, filling the unknown terms with neural networks (NN). They jointly optimize the DE parameters and NN weights using automatic differentiation and sensitivity analysis algorithms. This powerful approach was developed by members of the Julia community and is readily available to use in the DiffEqFlux.jl package. However, this method only works when one has direct measurements of the state variables of the DEs models, which is not always the case.\r\n\r\nThere exists a class of approaches that tackles this issue by constructing latent DE models, where other NN layers learn transformations from the input space to a latent DE space, usually with lower dimensionality. Some examples of this approach are LatentODEs [2,3] and GOKU-nets [4]. In a broad view, these models consist of a Variational Autoencoder structure with DEs inside. Their decoders contain the DEs, whose initial conditions (and in some cases, parameters) are sampled from distributions learned by the encoders. In the case of LatentODEs, NNs are used to approximate the latent ODE, while in the case of GOKU-nets, one can use prior knowledge to provide some ODE model for the latent dynamics.\r\n \r\nCurrently, Flux.jl and the SciML ecosystem have all the functionalities to build these latent DE models, but this process can be time-consuming and possibly has a steep learning curve for people without a background in machine learning. Our goal is to provide a package that makes latent differential equation models readily accessible with high flexibility in architecture and problem definition.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will introduce the basic background and concepts behind latent differential equation models, in particular, presenting the GOKU-net architecture. We will then show our implementation structure via a simple example: given videos of pendulums of different lengths, learn to reconstruct them by passing through their latent DE representation. We anticipate that our presentation shall be a user-friendly introduction to latent differential equations models for the Julia community. \r\n\r\n\r\nWork done in collaboration with:\r\n\r\nJean-Christophe Gagnon-Audet¹*  \r\nMahta Ramezanian¹  \r\nVikram Voleti¹  \r\nIrina Rish¹ \r\nPranav Mahajan² \r\nGuillermo Cecchi³  \r\nSilvina Ponce Dawson⁴  \r\nGuillaume Dumas¹\r\n\r\n*creator of the beautiful diagrams that you will see in the presentation   \r\n¹ Mila & Université de Montréal  \r\n² University of Pilani  \r\n³ IBM Research  \r\n⁴ CONICET & University of Buenos Aires  \r\n\r\n[1] Rackauckas, C., Ma, Y., Martensen, J., Warner, C., Zubov, K., Supekar, R., ... & Edelman, A.

  "description": "In this talk, I will give a panorama of `BifurcationKit.jl`, a Julia package to perform numerical bifurcation analysis of large dimensional equations (PDE, nonlocal equations, etc) using Matrix-Free / Sparse Matrix formulations of the problem. Notably, numerical bifurcation analysis can be done **entirely** on GPU.\r\n\r\n`BifurcationKit` incorporates continuation algorithms (PALC, deflated continuation, ...) which can be used to perform **fully automatic bifurcation diagram** computation of stationary states. I will showcase this with the 2d Bratu problem. I will also show an example of neural network that runs entirely on GPU.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, by leveraging on the above methods, the package can also seek for periodic orbits of Cauchy problems by casting them into an equation of high dimension. It is by now, one of the only softwares which provides parallel (Standard / Poincaré) shooting methods and finite differences based methods to compute periodic orbits in high dimensions. I will present an application highlighting the ability to fine tune `BifurcationKit` to get performance.",

It has turned out to be an excellent -- although at times frustrating! -- decision.\r\n\r\nPluto has allowed us to develop a completely new approach to writing both an interactive online textbook, as well as interactive problem sets with beautiful built-in solution checks that make working on problems both more fun and more rewarding. \r\n\r\nIndeed, the capabilities of the Pluto notebook itself have developed together with the course, as we have collaborated on the required tools and ideas. Many recent features in Pluto have been added with this style of teaching in mind, and we hope to inspire more teachers to write interactive material.\r\n\r\nHalf-way through the second semester, each video lecture consistently receives over 2,000 views, and the course website receives 6,000 hits per month. The interactive and self-checking nature of Pluto homeworks is especially useful in an open course, where students have to work on the material independently. \r\n\r\nWe will discuss ideas and goals for teaching Julia, computational thinking, concepts from computer and applied mathematics mixed together, and how the technical features of Pluto enable and enhance one another.\r\n\r\nCourse homepage with online interactive textbook: https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/",

  "description": "Doing data science effectively means working reproducibly. Although commitment to reproducibility as an ideal is non-controversial, in practice, it can be challenging to achieve. Many know this from their own experience, and the disconnect between ideal and reality has been well documented in recent years (see the [Fall 2020 issue of the Harvard Data Science Review](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/hn51kn68/release/3) for just one recent example).\r\n\r\n**Renku** is open-source software being developed at the **Swiss Data Science Center** as a solution for making reproducible data science easier to achieve. It builds upon established software such as *git*, *Docker*, and *Kubernetes* to provide tools necessary to work reproducibly, while offering the flexibility to support a variety of use cases and users working in any language they choose, including *Python*, *R*, and, of course, **Julia**.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will explain the architecture of the Renku platform and show how it can interact with Julia tools, in particular the `Pkg` package manager, to provide scaffolding for portable, reproducible Julia projects. Once we have a project set up, we will work through an example of building a reproducible workflow in Julia using Renku.\r\n\r\nThe same tools that support an individual working reproducibly can be used to [solve some of the hurdles that are encountered teaching a class to many students](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/issues-encountered-teaching-classes-with-julia-for-the-first-time/56553/8). As an example, we will present a set-up that could be used for teaching a class with Julia and provide a comparison of Renku vs. alternatives like Binder for this purpose.\r\n\r\nWe will conclude by looking at some more advanced topics for customizing a Julia-based environment for reproducibility by combining Renku with tools like VSCode, [Dr.Watson](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DrWatson.jl/dev/), or [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl).",

  "description": "The benefits of microservices architectures are well understood. They have the potential to be more agile, enable each service to pick the best technology for its purpose and be scaled or autoscaled appropriately, and can be easily deployed and managed through common open-source technologies.\r\n\r\nDeveloping a solution with a microservices architecture, however, can have some disadvantages. A developer creating a new microservice must understand the external interfaces to that service, how it is tested and deployed, and how to configure the service to run and scale as required. This increases the skill requirement of a developer and can take time away from what the developer is actually trying to do – create a new bit of functionality. It can also result in inconsistencies in code behaviour and style between services. This problem is compounded when the developers are using a new language and are unfamiliar with what is possible and with best practices, and further compounded when that language is itself rapidly developing.\r\n\r\nWe faced this challenge when developing a modelling and simulation platform built and deployed as Julia microservices. Julia was a new language for the majority of our team, and we needed to quickly design and deploy many services. Furthermore, we wanted to continue to use recent open-source developments without requiring that all of our developers must stay up to date with package and language advancements. To enable our developers to focus on what they’re best at (i.e., the functionality of the service they’re developing) and mitigate the issues mentioned, we made use of Julia’s excellent ecosystem to create a Software Development Kit (SDK).\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we describe the components of the SDK, how they enable both efficient development and use of new open-source advances, and how similar approaches can be used by your team as you build microservices. We will discuss how Julia’s package system makes it ideal for SDK use.\r\n\r\nLocated in a private registry, the SDK includes a microservice template, a utility package template, various utility packages and a custom GraphQL interface. The microservice template is the starting point for a developer writing a new microservice and includes the following functionality:\r\n\r\n- Default communication routes (service execution, liveness etc)\r\n- Logging behaviour\r\n- Automatic documentation\r\n- Asynchronous and multithreading tools\r\n- CICD scripts (testing, building and cloud deployment)\r\n\r\nWe will discuss the above, including detailing the various open-source packages used for each function.\r\n\r\nWe will also describe how providing utility packages in an SDK enables teams to make use of the best open-source developments, which may be developing and changing frequently, through a stable API. For example, when handling large volumes of data, it is often desirable to encode and decode numeric arrays to minimise data transfer. One package in our SDK provides a simple encode and decode interface, where the specifics of what compression packages are being used can be updated as required without the majority of users needing to stay abreast of open-source developments. We will detail this approach and give other examples of where we have found it useful. Finally, we will describe our custom GraphQL interface, which wraps a generic interface in a similar method to the utility packages, enabling developers to quickly interact with and make use of our platform.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, Julia is a powerful language with an exceptional ecosystem. In this talk, we will demonstrate how it can be used to create an efficient environment for microservice development which lets developers focus on what they’re developing, ensures all services use the best of the open-source community and generally makes things much more straightforward.",

  "description": "# First-Class, Composable Models\r\nSoss models can be used and composed similarly to working with functions. This allows models to be built up from smaller, reusable components. In some cases, these can be developed and tested independently.\r\n\r\n# Dynamic Code Generation\r\nSoss uses runtime code generation for efficient inference primitives. These are specialized for model and input types. New primitives can easily use arbitrary data structures; the system is very flexible. Models are fully generative and determine joint distributions. In particular, models have `rand` and `logdensity` methods like any other measure. \r\n\r\n# Model Transformations\r\nInternally, models are represented as a directed graph with an AST (a Julia `Expr`) at each node. This makes it easy to transform one model into another based on its dependencies or AST structures. We can compute Markov blankets or reparameterizations, or change a model to output the latent conditional distributions used along the way.\r\n\r\n# MeasureTheory.jl\r\nSoss uses MeasureTheory.jl and allows falling back to Distributions.jl when needed, so it inherits the benefits of MeasureTheory. For example, fewer type constraints on constructors means Soss can evaluate a log-density symbolically. Coupled with codegen, this enables generation of highly optimized code.",

  "description": "Predicting species occurrence is fundamental to biodiversity conservation and local policy-making. Multispecies occupancy models inform us about what species co-occur in a region and what factors make that region suitable for them. [Rota et al (2016)](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12587) proposed a generalization of the single-species occupancy model ([MacKenzie et al 2002](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/0012-9658%282002%29083%5B2248%3AESORWD%5D2.0.CO%3B2)) by assuming the latent occupancy state is a multivariate Bernoulli variable that is linked to an observed detection process. We compare the performance of Rota et al’s model fitted in **Stan** probabilistic language via the **RStan** interface with an equivalent model in **Turing.jl**. While both approaches resulted in similar parameter estimates, we found that Turing.jl required lower running times depending on model specification. We show that Turing’s performance was two hours faster than the one yielded by Stan, and the number of code lines was reduced from ~200 to ~100. Further code optimization by vectorizing observations from the multivariate Bernoulli distribution may reduce even more computation time. \r\nThere is an increasing number of ecologists interested in using the Julia language for implementing probabilistic modeling in their research. Providing them with programming resources that reduce computation time in their day-to-day modeling routines has become a major challenge in the big data era. Here, we report **benchmark** results that demonstrate the efficiency of the Julia language in terms of computation time when fitting complex occupancy models to a large data set. We encourage ecologists to use Julia for probabilistic models in order to improve the scalability of ecological science.\r\n\r\n**Authors**:\r\nJuan M Requena-Mullor.

  "description": "Machine learning is a promising approach in science and engineering for “filling the gaps” in modeling, particularly in cases where substantial volumes of training data are available. These techniques are becoming increasingly popular in the chemistry and materials science communities, as evidenced by the popularity of Python packages such as DeepChem and matminer. Clearly, there are many potential benefits to building, training, and running such models in Julia, including improved performance, better code readability, and perhaps most importantly, a multitude of prospects for composability with packages from the broader SciML ecosystem, allowing integration with packages for differential equation solving, sensitivity analysis, and more.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I introduce [Chemellia](https://github.com/chemellia): an ecosystem for machine learning on atomic systems based on Flux.jl. In particular, I will focus two packages I have been developing that will be core to Chemellia. [ChemistryFeaturization](https://github.com/Chemellia/ChemistryFeaturization.jl) represents a novel paradigm in data representation of molecules, crystals, and more. It defines flexible types for features associated with individual atoms, pairs of atoms, etc. as well as for representing featurized structures in the form of, for example, a crystal graph (the AtomGraph type, which of course dispatches the set of functions so that all of the LightGraphs analysis capabilities “just work”). It also implements an easily extensible set of modular featurization schemes to create inputs for a variety of models, graph-based and otherwise. A core design principle of the package is that all featurized data types carry the requisite metadata to “decode” their features back to human-readable values.\r\n\r\n[AtomicGraphNets](https://github.com/Chemellia/AtomicGraphNets.jl) provides a Julia implementation of the increasingly popular crystal graph convolutional neural net model architecture that trains and runs nearly an order of magnitude faster than the Python implementation, and requires fewer trainable parameters to achieve the same accuracy on benchmark tasks due to a more efficient and expressive convolutional operation. The layers provided by this package can be easily combined into other architectures using Flux’s utility functions such as Chain and Parallel.\r\n\r\nWe have some great summer student developers working on these packages now and would welcome further community feedback and contributions!",

  "description": "In hardware security, side-channel attackers can monitor analog signals, like the per-instruction power consumed. They can record this data during the execution of a cryptographic algorithm to gain additional information. Such leakage data can depend on intermediate values of the cipher, which themselves depend on the secret key. Hence, with such side-channel data, reconstructing the key of the cipher may become feasible.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we focus on using Julia’s type system to create a framework for generating, analyzing and protecting such side-channel data. For this purpose, we create custom types that behave like integers or arrays. When passing values of these types to a Julia implementation of a cryptographic algorithm, multiple dispatch automatically produces an instrumented or transformed version of that algorithm. Usually, this process does not require modifications to the algorithm’s original implementation.\r\n\r\nWe look in particular at two different functionalities that we can integrate via such custom types:\r\n- To simulate potential side-channel attacks, it is useful to generate data traces that depend on intermediate values. We will show how to construct types that log a trace of information about the values processed. This reduces the need for access to analog recording hardware, which is particularly useful when teaching side-channel security concepts in student practicals.\r\n- To explore protection against side-channel attacks, values that depend on the secret key should never appear in memory without protection. We explore how integer and array-like types can be created to implement a range of techniques for splitting register values into multiple shares, to reduce the dependence of leakage data on the actual values processed.\r\n\r\nJulia’s parametric type system allows us to arbitrarily stack those types on top of each other. For instance, protection types can be stacked on top of logging types. This construction allows us to conveniently collect traces of protected data which can be, for example, used to verify the effectiveness of the protection.\r\n\r\nPackage: https://github.com/parablack/CryptoSideChannel.jl\r\n<br>Documentation: https://parablack.github.io/CryptoSideChannel.jl/dev/\r\n<br>Dissertation: https://github.com/parablack/CryptoSideChannel.jl/raw/master/diss.pdf",

  "description": "Many consider economic inequality the biggest social challenge of the 21st century. Indeed, the distribution of disposable incomes, i.e. earned income (wages and salaries) minus income taxes, has become more unequal in recent years and a larger share is captured by the top 1%. Yet, it is a challenge to measure if this development is driven by changes in the distribution of earned income itself or if governmental efforts to redistribute from the rich to the poor have weakened. Accordingly, there are conflicting views among scientists on how to address increasing economic inequality. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I show how to use Julia to study the evolution of earned income and disposable income in the United States (US). While most researchers in the social sciences use software such as R and STATA for this purpose, my talk demonstrates that Julia is a superb alternative. To illustrate a concrete application, I use a new Julia package, Taxsim.jl, to investigate if the US tax system has become more or less redistributive during the last decades; income taxes paid are not reported in survey datasets and Taxsim.jl allows to impute them efficiently by uploading data from the Julia workspace to the tax calculator of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). The calculator then computes a number of tax variables (income taxes, tax credits, etc.) and Taxsim.jl downloads them back into Julia.\r\n\r\nMy talk has three elements. First, I give a brief introduction to the NBER tax calculator and describe its input and return variables. Second, I use CSV.jl and DataFrames.jl to import and inspect information on individual incomes contained in publicly available and easily accessible survey datasets (ACS, CPS, Census). Finally, I apply Taxsim.jl to impute income taxes paid via a simple function call and I compare the evolution of before- and after-tax household incomes in the United States since 1960 to measure the redistributive effects of the US tax system. Thus, my talk uses Julia to answer a question which is at the center of public debates on inequality.\r\n\r\nThe Julia workflow I present can be adjusted to suit a large range of applications. Moreover, Taxsim.jl allows to investigate many aspects of the US tax system, such as the role of tax credits, deductions, state tax policies, etc. Hence, beyond the general Julia user community, the particular target group of this talk are researchers in quantitative social sciences (economics, finance, sociology, public policy etc).",

  "description": "In selective laser melting, a powder material is locally melted by a laser and forms a coherent solid structure after cooling. As a major advantage this process allows the fabrication of complex geometries and is suitable for various materials. On the downside, the process is associated with extreme cooling rates and therefore large temperature gradients, which lead to anisotropic material properties and, in worst case, to inferior component properties. Hence process parameters such as laser power, scanning speed and layer height must be determined optimally and individually for each component. Due to vast range and variety of influencing factors and parameters, simulations provide an ideal environment for test and development purpose. In order to consider process effects and interactions in a uniform manner to take the effects and interactions of the process into account in a uniform manner, simulations from micro to macro level with associated time scales are necessary. As a consequence, computational heavy and tedious models need to be solved. Current implementations are mostly available in MATLAB, which leads to performance bottlenecks at several points. Due to its performance, syntax and free availability by MIT license, Julia provides an excellent opportunity to completely detach previous implementations from MATLAB and to use Julia as a holistic framework in the future. Particularly the possibility of fully integrating the graphics processing unit (GPU) into computation while still programming in Julia, promises a well readable and still very performant code for the high performance computing (HPC) application.",

  "description": "Through the rise in popularity of deep learning and large-scale numerical simulations, high-performance computing (HPC) has entered the mainstream of scientific computing. Today, HPC techniques are increasingly required by a wider and wider audience, in fields including machine and deep learning, weather forecasting, medical and seismic imaging, computational genomics, fluid dynamics and others. HPC workloads have been traditionally deployed to on-premise high-performance computing clusters and were therefore only available to a very limited number of researchers or corporations. With the rise of cloud computing, HPC resources have in principle become available to a much wider audience but managing HPC infrastructure in the cloud is challenging. As the cloud provides a fundamentally different computing infrastructure from on-premise supercomputer, users need build environments and applications that are resilient are cost efficient and that are able to leverage cloud-related opportunities such as elastic (hyper-scale) compute and heterogeneous infrastructure.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the current approach to port HPC applications to the cloud is to replicate the infrastructure of on-premise supercomputing centers with cloud resources. Cloud services such as AWS ParallelCluster or Azure CycleCloud enable users to create virtual HPC clusters that consist of login nodes, job schedulers, a set of compute instances, networking and distributed storage systems. Even cloud-native approaches such as Kubernetes follow this cluster-based architecture, albeit using containerization and novel schedulers. However, from the user side both approaches are a two-step approach in which users first create a (virtual) HPC cluster in the cloud and then submit their parallel program to the cluster. This makes running HPC applications in the cloud challenging, as users have to act as cluster administrators who manage the HPC infrastructure before being able to run their application.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we argue for the case of clusterless supercomputing in the cloud in which the user application essentially takes over the role of the job scheduler and cluster orchestrator. Instead of a\r\ntwo-step process in which users first create a cluster and then submit their job to it, the application is executed anywhere and dynamically manages the required compute infrastructure at runtime. To enable this type of clusterless HPC which is heavily inspired by serverless orchestration frameworks, we introduce Redwood, an open-source software package for clusterless supercomputing on the Azure cloud. Redwood provides a set of distributed programming macros that are designed in accordance with Julia's existing macros for distributed computing around the principles of remote function calls and futures. Unlike Julia's standard distributed computing framework, Redwood does not require a parallel Julia session that is running on a set of interconnected nodes (i.e., a cluster). Instead, Redwood executes functions that are tagged for remote (parallel) execution via cloud services such as Azure batch or Azure Functions by creating a closure around the executed code and running it remotely through the respective cloud service. Results, namely function outputs, are written to cloud object stores and remote references are returned to the user.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we discuss the architecture and implementation of Redwood and present HPC scenarios that are enable by it. This includes large-scale MapReduce workloads, computations that are distributed across multiple data centers or even regions, as well as combinations of data and model parallel applications in which users can execute multiple distributed-memory MPI workloads in parallel. Additionally, we present how existing Julia packages such as Flux or JUDI (a framework for PDE-constrained optimization) can be cloud-natively deployed through Redwood, without requiring users to set up HPC clusters.",

This talk presents Enzyme.jl, a Julia frontend for the Enzyme high performance LLVM automatic differentiation (AD) toolkit. By operating at a low level, Enzyme is able to run optimizations prior to differentiation and is therefore highly efficient on scalar code and can support mutation out of the box. We explain how Enzyme.jl integrates with the Julia compiler, supports synthesis for Julia GPU kernels, and propagates Julia knowledge of types to the lower-level tool. We will discuss ongoing work to extend Enzyme.jl to be able to differentiate through Julia language features like dynamic calls and garbage collection. We will conclude by describing the potential of combining high level and low level systems to get the benefit of both algebraic and instruction level optimizations, and using Enzyme.jl in other AD systems such as Zygote.jl or Diffractor.jl to perform differentiation of foreign function calls, enabling cross-language AD.",

  "description": "Distribution networks are the final stage of the delivery of power from generation to consumers, and they have traditionally been managed with a fit-and-forget approach. This has been appropriate until recent years, given the predictable behavior and underutilization of these networks. However, several developments are changing the state of affairs, e.g., electric vehicles, PV panels, etc. These devices increase utilization, unpredictability, and the risk of voltage and congestion problems, but also provide a potential source of flexibility and control.\r\nTo understand the impact of these technologies and, potentially, to perform control actions, it is necessary to monitor distribution systems. State estimation (SE) is a monitoring tool that determines the most-likely state of the system given a set of measurements. \r\nIn this talk/poster, a (registered) Julia package is presented, PowerModelsDistributionStateEstimation.jl, which has been developed as a SE design facilitator. The main goal is to provide a flexible tool that allows researchers or other interested users to easily and rapidly design and benchmark SE techniques. This, in turn, has the potential to accelerate the real-life deployment of monitoring and control routines, which can play an important role in the management and operation of future power grids.\r\nThe package is an extension of PowerModelsDistribution.jl (https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModelsDistribution.jl), and it allows to formulate SE as a constrained optimization problem. Usually, SE is not addressed in a strict mathematical optimization sense, but the latter is a more general way to describe the problem, which encapsulates the different methods available in the literature, making benchmarking easier. \r\nThe biggest challenge in the comparison of SE methods is that the solving algorithm is an inherent part of the SE model. This means that changes in the model-defining equations often require changes in the subsequent solving steps, making it very labor-intensive and time-consuming to test even a limited number of modeling options. With this package we break this paradigm, by splitting the modeling and solver layer, which is possible by using JuMP.jl. This allows users to focus on the design of a suitable SE model, letting an off-the-shelf solver, e.g., Ipopt, take care of the solving part. \r\nA potential drawback is that solve times are longer than with a customized algorithm. However, numerical experiments with available solvers show solve times that seem acceptable for experimental and real-life use. If a better performance is required, the package can still be used to quickly find the optimal SE design, which the user can augment with a customized solver at a later stage. \r\nSeveral SE modeling options (e.g., measurement types, power flow equations), are available in the package, which is easy to extend to include more. \r\nThe talk will give a short overview on the concept of SE, to then introduce the package in detail and provide some numerical examples to demonstrate its functionalities.",

  "description": "Design By Contract is a method recommended in several Software Engineering best practices books such as the \"Pragmatic Programmer\" and \"Clean Code\". Design By Contract uses the paradigm of failing as fast and as often as possible to make sure we can detect the majority of bugs and unexpected behavior inside our code. This is done by ensuring the program in development will maintain state by executing a given set of assertions in every function, loop, or even data type, i.e. by making sure some conditions will always be true. Different from Unit Testing, Design by Contract will run all these assertions in runtime, reaching edge cases that are only found when using the program daily. It also makes the code cleaner and more literate by expressing the bounds of every structure, helping out when reading and unit testing it. Our implementation can disable the assertions for a more efficient runtime in production. Our Julian implementation of DBC uses macros and multiple dispatch, enabling for cohesive software development and review.",

  "description": "When doing research on numerical discretization methods, scientists are often faced with a dilemma when choosing the appropriate simulation tool: In the beginning of a project, you often want a code that is nimble and with low overhead, which allows rapid prototyping to assist you in experimenting with different approaches. Later on, however, you want to evaluate your newly developed methods and algorithms in a production setting and require a high-performance implementation, support for parallelization, and a full toolchain for postprocessing and visualizing your results.\r\n\r\nWith [Trixi.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl), we try to bridge this gap by using a simple but modular architecture, which allows us to easily extend Trixi beyond the existing functionality. The main components, such as the mesh, the solvers, or the equations, can each be selected and combined individually in a library-like manner. At the same time, Trixi is a comprehensive numerical simulation framework for hyperbolic PDEs and comes with all necessary ingredients to set up a simulation, run it in parallel, and visualize the results.\r\n\r\nAt its core, various systems of equations are solved on hierarchical quadtree/octree grids that provide adaptive mesh refinement via solution-based indicators. The equations, e.g., compressible Euler, ideal MHD, or hyperbolic diffusion, are discretized with high-order discontinuous Galerkin spectral element methods, with support for entropy-stable shock capturing. Trixi puts an emphasis on having a fast implementation with shared memory parallelization, and integrates well with other packages of the Julia ecosystem, such as [OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl) for time integration, [ForwardDiff.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl) for automatic differentiation, or [Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl) for visualization. One of the key goals of Trixi is to be useful to experienced researchers while remaining accessible for new users or students. Thus, we continuously strive to keep the implementation as simple as reasonably possible. \r\n\r\nDue to Julia’s unique capabilities and ecosystem including [LoopVectorization.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSIMD/LoopVectorization.jl), serial performance of Trixi can be on par with large-scale C++ and Fortran projects in performance benchmarks using a subset of optimized methods. At the same time, the general framework is simple and extendable enough to allow porting new solver infrastructures within a few hours.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will give an overview of the currently implemented features and discuss the overall architecture of Trixi. We will show a typical workflow for creating and running a simulation, and present scientific results that were obtained with Trixi. Finally, we will demonstrate how to add new capabilities to Trixi for your own research projects.\r\n\r\nThe Jupyter notebook used for the live demonstration of Trixi.jl during the talk, as well as the presentation slides, can be found at https://github.com/trixi-framework/talk-2021-juliacon.",

  "description": "### Introduction\r\nThe project is built by several members from the  Humans of Julia community on Discord. The team has diverse backgrounds and skill levels. It is a joint effort of enthusiastic people to enhance the Julia ecosystem and serves as an educational and open source project.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to implement a new client library in Julia, in addition to the existing clients in Java, NodeJS and Python. Users of the Julia client will benefit from the Julia specific features like clean syntax, strong typing, multiple dispatch and speed. \r\n\r\nBuilding this client requires the team to push forward a couple of technologies:\r\n\r\n- Use Behavior.jl package for  BDD (behaviour driven development)  \r\n- Stabilize  gRPC.jl and related packages (now we are using gRPCClient.jl)\r\n- Dealing with protocol buffers\r\n\r\n### Applicability to the Julia community.\r\nThe Julia community can benefit from having access to the TypeDB database, in all fields related to data science, which can make use of automatic inference and gain new insights from knowledge like in pharmacological research, financial services, machine learning, text mining and more. It is a new tool in the chain to tackle modern problems in modern ways.\r\n\r\n### Contributions to the community.\r\nThe TypeDBClient.jl package will be available in the general registry as a MIT licensed package.\r\nRepository: https://github.com/Humans-of-Julia/TypeDBClient.jl\r\n\r\n### Clarity and what to expect from the talk\r\nThe talk is giving an introduction to the development process and what challenges we face so far and in which way we approach them. This includes the use of other libraries that have been brought back to life, like gRPC.jl or Behavior.jl. Also, it gives some insights of the team approach from a community perspective, working from different time zones and backgrounds.\r\n\r\n### Significance to the community.\r\nThe significance of this package comes from its diverse capabilities of application. As a so-called intelligent database, it can help with all kinds of use cases that incorporate data and knowledge engineering.",

  "description": "Metabolic reconstructions of different organisms from experimental evidence and bioinformatics based knowledge are widely used to facilitate the study of biological systems.  All of these reconstructions are inherently incomplete due to our lack of complete experimental and/or homology information.  A number of computational approaches have been proposed to detect gaps in a metabolic network and subsequently generate hypotheses to fix these gaps. The optimization based GapFind and GapFill approach proposed by Maranas and coworkers is one of the most widely used. \r\n \r\nThe previous implementation of GapFind and GapFill was in GAMS, which charges a significant amount of license fee from every single user, even though many solvers are free for an academic purpose.  To promote the usage of this computational model, we developed an open-source Julia package, GapFindFill.jl, which enables researchers to use this framework for free by harnessing the power of academic free solvers.\r\nBuilt upon Julia and its optimization language JuMP, GapFindFill.jl provides users interfaces to a well-established metabolic reconstruction curation model.  Benefited from the high-performance and general-purpose features of Julia, GapFindFill.jl allows users to embed network curation problems into other computational tasks, which the previous implementation in GAMS could not due to the limitation of GAMS itself.\r\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of GapFindFill.jl, two examples from a published paper were used for validation. The package is a registered package and can be installed easily in Julia.",

As such it is particularly interesting for models based on Gaussian processes. In this talk we\r\npresent [EllipticalSliceSampling.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/EllipticalSliceSampling.jl), a Julia package for elliptical slice sampling.\r\n\r\nThe package offers a simple yet very general implementation of the algorithm. Users can specify models that with an arbitrary Julia function of the log-likelihood and a Gaussian prior that has to satisfy a simple interface. This interface ensures that sampling can be performed efficiently for custom types of priors. It is implemented for Gaussian distributions in Distributions.jl, and hence EllipticalSliceSampling.jl supports these distributions as priors out of the box. ArrayInterface.jl is used to optimize sampling automatically for mutable types of samples, regardless of the employed prior.\r\n\r\nSince EllipticalSliceSampling.jl implements the AbstractMCMC.jl interface for MCMC algorithms, features such as progress logging, thinning, discarding of initial samples, and parallel sampling with multiple threads or processes are provided automatically. Due to the simple nature of the elliptical slice\r\nsampling algorithm, EllipticalSliceSampling.jl contains a concise and minimal implementation of the interface and can serve as a reference implementation for other developers.\r\n\r\nIn general, EllipticalSliceSampling.jl integrates well with other Julia packages. For instance, it can be used to perform inference of Gaussian process models built with AbstractGPs.jl. Additionally, the Turing probabilistic programming language contains first-class support for elliptical slice sampling via\r\nEllipticalSliceSampling.jl. It can serve as inference method for models with solely Gaussian priors and as component of a Gibbs sampler for more general classes of models that contain non-Gaussian priors as well.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\nMurray, I., Adams, R. & MacKay, D..

  "description": "This talk will be divided into roughly three sections.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nJulia is an awesome language for manipulating data, with excellent built-in functionality that is easy to extend by packages and users. Arrays, sets and dictionaries form the basis of core data structures necessary for a wide range of workloads. Of the three, Julia's `AbstractArray` interface is most extensive — supporting a wide range of data structures *and* a rich set of operations, designed around the same core set of functionality (primarily, indexing and iteration).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, `AbstractSet` and `AbstractDict` do not support such a wide range of operations (like broadcasting, `map`, or `reduce`) and the interface for a user to create a new, fully-functional `AbstractDict` is not as clear cut or simple as it is for an array. *Dictionaries.jl* is an attempt to remedy this situation, by applying the learnings of the `AbstractArray` interface to create a new `AbstractDictionary` interface. By using *Dictionaries.jl*, users can experience improved programmer productivity as well as signficantly faster execution for many operations (especially with analytics-style workloads).\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\nA *Dictionaries.jl* `AbstractDictionary` differs from Julia's `AbstractDict` in three main ways:\r\n\r\n 1. Dictionaries iterate values, like an array, instead of key-value pairs.\r\n 2. The indices (or `keys`) of dictionary are a special kind of dictionary, much like the indices (or `keys`) of an array is a special kind of array.\r\n 3. Dictionaries (and their indices) by default iterate in a well-defined order based on insertion, rather than quasi-randomly based on how the hashmap was constructed.\r\n\r\nSince the indices of a dictionary are distinct, they naturally form a set (in the mathematical sense). In *Dictionaries.jl* this type is represented by `AbstractIndices <: AbstractDictionary` (unlike for `Dict`, there was no obvious alternative spelling of `Set` available). Every `AbstractIndices` has the special property that it's values are the same as it's keys, so if `i ∈ indices` then `indices[i]` is just `i`.\r\n\r\nFrom these alone, natural definitions of `broadcast`, `map`, `filter` and `reduce` follow, for both indices (i.e. \"sets\") or dictionaries. For example, the `map` operation preserves the indices and maps the values to new values. You can even `map` a set of indices/keys into a new dictionary.\r\n\r\nThis property leads to *Dictionaries.jl*'s primary efficiency gain. The indices of dictionaries (i.e. the expensive part) can be shared between different dictionaries. For example, the provided hashmap `Dictionary` can share its hash `Indices` with other dictionaries. The values are stored in a (mostly) dense array, so operating on all the values with an operation like `map`, `filter` and `reduce` is as fast as it is for a similarly sized array. One can use `map` or `broadcast` with multiple similar dictionaries (i.e. those that share compatible \"tokens\"), co-iterating values together at speed and with zero hash lookups.\r\n\r\n### Applications\r\n\r\nWe will turn our attention to some example applications of this interface, first highlighting the convenience and speed of `Dictionary` for some common analytics tasks.\r\n\r\nWe will then see how *Dictionaries.jl* is used in conjunction with other packages, for example how *SplitApplyCombine.jl*'s `group` operation now supports a simple and easy split-apply-combine workflow.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will explore recent work in *TypedTables.jl* which uses *Dictionaries.jl* to provide a table with a primary key (enabling easy lookup of rows based on data rather than an array index). The idea is similarly extended to grouped/partitioned data tables and their grouping keys.",

  "description": "Like most fields of science, in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) our appetite for data is never satiated – spatiotemporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio can never be too high, and MRI scan times can never be too low. But, with big data comes big compute. MRI image reconstruction, for example, often involves parallel acquisition of multiple (3+1)D MRI images as measured by each of the 32+ scanner readout coils which are then combined through a complex series of iterative optimization problems. These types of algorithms are typically prototyped in high-level programming languages like Matlab or Python, and subsequently translated to C/C++ for deployment. The Julia community is familiar with this old story, though – in fact the fantastic package MRIReco.jl (https://github.com/MagneticResonanceImaging/MRIReco.jl) by Knopp et al. provides Julia implementations of MRI reconstruction algorithms which are competitive with C/C++. Post-processing these reconstructed MRI images faces similar computational challenges, and in this talk, we will describe our experience of implementing a parameter inference algorithm from the MRI subfield of myelin water imaging (MWI) in Julia.\r\n\r\nIn MWI, one analyses (3+1)D time series of image volumes acquired on cartesian spatiotemporal grids with dimensions 250x250x250x64 or more. The MRI time signals acquired in each voxel, which exhibit multi-exponential decay, are decomposed into a spectrum of decay rates. These decay rates are used to compute, among other useful metrics, the myelin water fraction (MWF) which is known to correlate with local myelin content in the brain. This inverse Laplace transform-like computation involves fitting an MRI signal model – the extended phase graph (EPG) model – to each time signal by solving an L2 regularized nonnegative least squares (NNLS) optimization problem. Note that, with images typically consisting of 10^7 voxels or more, this computation requires solving upwards of 10^7 optimization problems.\r\n\r\nPrior to this work, the NNLS procedure used for MWI was implemented in Matlab – a closed-source high-level programming language – as is common in MRI research. This computation is particularly poorly suited for Matlab, however. First, similar to the Python library numpy, Matlab encourages computations on vectors or matrices, as opposed to explicit for-loops, in order to call out to BLAS or LAPACK libraries and ameliorate the overhead of the Matlab interpreter. For this reason, the EPG algorithm – which is most efficiently expressed in terms of nested for-loops – was previously implemented in terms of sparse matrix-vector products in order to avoid Matlab’s slow loops. Second, while the solving of independent optimization problems from each voxel is embarrassingly parallel, Matlab provides little control over multiprocessing optimizations such as reusing thread-local memory buffers and task scheduling. Lastly, Matlab does not provide a statically sized array type, which would be beneficial for micro-optimizing 3x3 matrix-vector products present in the EPG algorithm.\r\n\r\nJulia excels in these types of computations. In the DEcomposition and Component Analysis of Exponential Signals (DECAES.jl) package (https://github.com/jondeuce/DECAES.jl, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.zemedi.2020.04.001), we provide optimized procedures for computing MWI which address the aforementioned limitations of Matlab, and additionally include command line and Matlab interfaces for ease of interoperability. In all, DECAES.jl reduced computation times approximately 60X from 1.5-2.5 hours down to 1.5-2.5 mins. This large speedup demonstrates that it is possible to perform this analysis directly on the MRI scanner, removing the need for researchers to (manually) process the acquired data.\r\n\r\nAmong the many additional benefits from the Julia translation is the synergy with other Julia packages: we experimented with explicit SIMD vectorization in the EPG algorithm using the SIMD.jl package; we make liberal use of statically sized vectors and matrices using the StaticArrays.jl package; we use a pure-Julia implementation of NNLS using the NNLS.jl package. Furthermore, the EPG algorithm is independently useful outside of MWI, and can e.g. be efficiently differentiated trivially using the automatic differentiation packages ForwardDiff.jl or Zygote.jl.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we have found that the combination of high-performance and high-expressibility present in Julia is well suited to MRI research, particularly in comparison to existing Matlab-based workflows, and we believe that our experience will resonate with the scientific computing community more broadly. We look forward to the opportunity to share our experience.",

  "description": "Structures in civil engineering are traditionally modelled using the finite element (FE) method. Although it is an extremely successful method, it has some shortcomings: (i) it can require substantial human effort to build complex models; and (ii) it can be difficult to combine with measurement data in order to increase model prediction accuracy. A way to overcome these shortcomings is to use data-driven machine learning approaches, however these may require a prohibitive amount of measurement data and still perform poorly in extrapolation. Combining the machine learning model with scientific knowledge, i.e. scientific machine learning (SciML), may offer a practically tenable solution to the above challenges.\r\n\r\nThis talk aims to explore to what extent a scientific machine learning model can predict the structural response of a twin girder bridge in comparison with a data-driven machine learning model. The two approaches are compared with regards to prediction accuracy as well as the amount of data needed to achieve a particular accuracy. The comparison is made by using a synthetic case and a real-world case with field measurements.\r\n\r\nThe scientific machine learning model requires a formulation of the physics, which can be done in different manners. In engineering practice the structural behavior of bridges is typically described/predicted by FE models. For the SciML physics formulation we selected a simplified 2D beam model made up of 4-degrees-of-freedom linear elastic beam elements. This simple 2D-model is chosen in order to explore a very fast modelling workflow, potentially expandable to a digital tool for quick structural assessment. The 2D model is combined with a neural network in order to approximate the 3D bridge behavior. The neural network achieves this by representing a transverse load distribution function that describes what percentage of a concentrated load at a certain location is carried by the modelled 2D girder. As the bridge is composed of two identical girders, the rest of the load is assumed to be carried by the second girder. We do not take shear lag effects into account in our physics formulation. \r\n\r\nThe loss for the SciML model was calculated in three steps: first, the load on the 2D beam was determined by the neural network, second, the structural system is solved for this predicted load and sensor position, finally the loss is calculated using the difference of the predicted structural responses and the measured ones.\r\n\r\nFor the data-driven model, a feedforward neural network tries to directly predict the structural response of the 2D girder for a certain sensor and load location. The difference between this prediction and the measured data is used to calculate the loss for the training of the neural network.\r\n\r\nWe chose to make the implementation of the SciML model in Julia because of its many attractive features, such as multiple dispatch and packages for automatic differentiation (e.g. Zygote.jl) and machine learning (e.g. Flux.jl). For the FE package, we wanted a lightweight, hackable package that would be easy to get started with, in order to provide a fast workflow. It was also desirable to have a 100% Julia written FE package, in order to fully utilize Zygote for backpropagating the FE solutions. We chose CALFEM.jl, a Julia port of the CALFEM package, originally developed in the late 1970s at Lund University in Sweden and subsequently improved over the decades, today typically used for teaching simple FE programming. CALFEM.jl lacks support for automatic differentiation, but because of the many favorable features of Julia, it was a quite simple task to implement AD support for the components that we needed. The source code of the analysis will be made open to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results show that a SciML approach can accurately predict structural behavior of the bridge using far less data points than a purely data driven approach. Moreover, the SciML approach is much better in extrapolation than the purely data-driven one. Our results show that at the moment purely data-driven approaches are impractical to predict structural responses and SciML seems to be a very promising addition to the toolbox of structural modelling approaches.",

  "description": "Learning from raw data input, thus limiting the need for manual feature engineering, is one of the key components of many successful applications of machine learning methods. While machine learning problems are often formulated on data that naturally translate into a vector representation suitable for classifiers, there are data sources, for example in cybersecurity, that are naturally represented in diverse files with a unifying hierarchical structure, such as XML, JSON, and Protocol Buffers.\r\n\r\n Converting this data to vector (tensor) representation is generally done by manual feature engineering, which is laborious, lossy, and prone to human bias about the importance of particular features. \r\n \r\nMill.jl and Jsongrinder.jl is a tandem of libraries,  which fully automates the conversion.

While machine learning problems are often formulated on data that naturally translate into a vector representation suitable for classifiers, there are data sources with a unifying hierarchical structure, such as JSON. This talk will describe Mill.jl and JsonGrinder.jl, which offers a theoretically justified approach to solve machine learning problems with these data sources."

  "description": "The rational placement of aminoacids in a sequence directly correlates to the 3D structure of the peptide, once folded, which, in turn, dictates the interactions with the environment and therefore the function of the peptide. Being able to design new peptides for specific functions would unlock the potential of unknown conformations not yet explored by nature, with applications in medical fields, agriculture, biological remediation, enzymatic synthesis, among others. \r\n\r\nThis was traditionally explored by random blind mutagenesis which is an expensive and time intensive experimental practise. With the evolution of computational power over the last couple of decades, computational design of small proteins has become the focus of scientific breakthroughs. Using computer simulations saves precious time and monetary costs of experiments, focusing efforts on simulated prototypes that have shown promising results. As such, multiple software solutions have been proposed over the years. An example would be Rosetta (and its Python wrap, PyRosetta), which has been indisputably invaluable as a platform for molecular manipulation and peptide design.\r\nHowever, as it happens with so many scientific-purposed software packages, Rosetta has fallen into the two-language problem, where the core of the simulation code is written in C with a more user-friendly wrap in Python that exposes some of the functionality. This has gravelly impaired the community ability to upgrade and modify this package, as well as imposing a steep learning curve to non-specialized would-be-users.\r\n\r\nProtoSyn, empowered by the Julia language ecosystem, aims to put forward a simple and easy to use platform for molecular manipulation and peptide design. A Julia-based solution to this challenge would naturally benefit from the native features of the language, such as easy parallelization and distributed computing, GPU acceleration and machine learning tools, among others. A list of current features of ProtoSyn includes: the removal, addition and mutation of an indiscriminate number of aminoacids, rigid body docking of ligands, Monte-Carlo and steepest descent drivers and rotamer library search, among others. As a whole, this list of features constitutes the core of ProtoSyn: a playground for the development and prototyping of new sequences and structures of proteins. A set of extra features has been identified and initial support for them has been prepared. These include branched structures, user interface with a UI and even molecular dynamic drivers, but further development in these modules is needed.\r\n\r\nFor the steepest descent and Monte-Carlo simulations, a critical component of any molecular manipulation software is the definition of an energy function: a fitness evaluating function that measures how realistic a given molecular structure is. “TorchANI” is a machine learning model trained on DFT results, providing realistic results with up to 10e6 speedup in computation times, and has been developed in Python by a team of researchers from Florida. Using PyCall package, this external Python package is loaded and used in Julia as the core piece of the ProtoSyn’s energy function. Other components include the Caterpillar Solvation Energy as well as a Contact Map restraint.\r\n\r\nOverall, ProtoSyn is able to provide an easy to use, intuitive and robust experience in molecular manipulation, allowing even non-specialized users access to basic simulation tools that can greatly reduce prototyping costs and experimental time. ProtoSyn is also fast, being accelerated by both GPU and SIMD technologies, and easily employing distributed computing protocols allows us to speed simulations even further. In conclusion, the first development cycle of ProtoSyn is hopefully coming to a close, with final tests, documentation, examples and tutorials being prepared. The open-source code in finally ready for the community to check and improve upon.",

  "description": "Topology optimization is a field that combines physics simulation and (mathematical) optimization to optimize the shapes and designs of physical systems. It is an extremely rich and fast growing field with its roots in structural and solid mechanics design but is quickly growing into other areas of physics and engineering. Being a fast growing research field, there is still no consensus on what functionality must be available in a decent topology optimization software. The ability to easily experiment with existing algorithms and easily define new problems to apply algorithms on is something that TopOpt.jl takes to a whole new level. Manually deriving gradients of long chained functions is still embarrassingly half of almost every important topology optimization paper in the field to this day! TopOpt.jl hopes to eliminate the need for this using automatic differentiation (Zygote.jl). Some custom adjoint rules are necessary to define for efficiency but automatic differentiation makes the software design and the API for defining custom adjoints much more pleasant than the status quo of re-inventing automatic differentiation for every new objective, constraint, sub-function, physical system, etc. The modular design of TopOpt.jl also allows a near complete segregation of the objective and constraint definitions from the mathematical optimization algorithm implementations which enables both to grow asynchronously appeasing to different audiences with different sets of expertise.",

  "description": "Data generated on modern aquaculture farms extend across a wide variety of forms. In situ sensors sample large numbers of environmental variables such as temperature, current velocity, dissolved oxygen (DO), chlorophyll and salinity. Remotely-sensed environmental data can sample much larger spatial domains and can be at the bay-scale – from land-based sensors such as CODAR-type HF radar – or at the global scale from satellite-based monitoring system. Informing on farm operations also requires sampling of animal variables such as size, clustering behaviour, and movement, and this is typically done using underwater technologies such as hydroacoustic technology, video monitoring, and aerial drone imagery. Further, there are large datasets of pertinent variables that are generated by numerical models such as weather or ocean circulation products. These datasets constitute huge data volumes with distinct characteristics. Integrating and extracting information from these disparate data sources (in scalable manner) are key to encapsulating the full dynamics of the farm environment and enabling effective management. \r\n\r\nThis paper presents an analysis of environmental and fish behaviour datasets collected at three salmon farms in Norway, Scotland, and Canada. Information on fish behaviour were collected using hydroacoustic sensors that sampled the vertical distribution of fish in a cage at high spatial and temporal resolution, while a network of environmental sensors characterised local site conditions. We present an analysis of the environmental and hydroacoustic datasets using the Julia open-source packages we developed: data were preprocessed and curated into time-aligned matrix form using TSML (https://github.com/IBM/TSML.jl), and machine learning pipelines were identified and implemented using Lale (https://github.com/IBM/Lale.jl). \r\n\r\nAnalysis enabled a quantitative investigation of the effects of environmental conditions on fish response together with information on drivers of anomalous fish response. Results demonstrated pronounced temporal variations in fish distribution as dictated by factors such as diurnal patterns, dynamics (currents and winds), and oxygen and temperature variations. Diurnal patterns driven by natural changes in light intensity were broadly similar across sites although this trend was ameliorated at the Norwegian site which was located inside the Arctic circle and experience 24 hours of daylight during summer months. Generally, fish occupied a deeper position in the cage during the day and were more tightly clustered; while at night, fish utilised more of the cage volume and were at a higher average position. \r\nAnalysis indicated that temperature was the primary environmental driver at two of the three sites. Temperature in the warmer summer months exhibited pronounced stratification before returning to a well-mixed temperature profile in September and October. During these stratified periods there was a tendency for fish to cluster to the warmer, upper portion of the cage and avoid colder temperatures. On the other hand, in reasonably homogeneous environments where temperature varies little with depth (such as at the Canada site during autumn), temperature did not influence the vertical distribution of salmon.\r\n\r\nVariation in oxygen levels were most pronounced at the Canada site which showed consistently lower values than at other sites. Feature importance analysis indicated that dissolved oxygen values were the most important contributor to fish behaviour and in particular during periods of lower oxygen levels, a pronounced response was noted. Analysis indicated that fish moved towards the surfaces when values drop below 7mgL-1 which is in line with literature which reports reduced appetites and feeding in Atlantic salmon when values drop below this threshold. \r\n\r\nResults presented in this paper indicate pronounced differences between sites and the need to consider these variations for farm management. One could readily use this analysis to quantify the difference between sites, and further to identify the fundamental drivers to these variations. This could be particularly valuable when comparing different farm systems such as inshore and offshore and the associated operational implications.",

  "description": "Modia (www.ModiaSim.org) is a set of Julia packages for modeling and simulation of coupled multidomain engineering systems (electrical, 3D mechanical, fluid, etc.). It shares many powerful features of the Modelica (www.Modelica.org) language. In the talk status and plans for Modia are presented.\r\n\r\nA new simple, yet powerful syntax has been introduced in Modia based on named tuples of Julia and recursive merge. An electrical Resistor can, for example, be defined as:\r\n\r\n\tResistor = OnePort | Model( R = 1.0u\"Ω\", equation = :[ R*i = v ] )\r\n\r\nThe | denotes a recursive merge between the named tuple OnePort and a new Model (named tuple) adding a parameter R and Ohms equation, i.e., corresponding to extending the model OnePort having variables and equations. Such a resistor can then be instantiated:\r\n\r\n\tR = Resistor | Map(R=0.5u\"Ω\")\r\n\r\nwith an updated value of the resistance R. The Model constructor constructs a named tuple which only adds attributes during merge and Map only updates attributes. This use of named tuples unifies and generalizes inheritance, hierarchical modifiers and replaceable models of Modelica. Component instances such as R have ports (defined in OnePort) which are connected to form complete hierarchical system models.\r\n\r\nFor certain kinds of models, such as multibody systems, the order of evaluating the component equations is independent of the model topology. This means that algorithmic functions can be used for each model component and called according to the connection topology. This avoids repeated structural and symbolic analysis of the multibody equations, the code size is considerably reduced, and pre-compilation is possible. Modia allows to express such kinds of models together with equation-based models. \r\n\r\nNew symbolic algorithms transform the Modia equations to ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations in state space form) and generate a Julia function that can be used to simulate the transformed model with ODE integrators of DifferentialEquations.jl. \r\n\r\nWhen instantiating a Modia model, the floating point type of the Modia variables can be defined. This allows for example to easily model uncertainty propagation with Measurements.jl or perform Monte Carlo Simulation with MonteCarloMeasurements.jl. The hierarchical NamedTuple description of a model can be easily mapped to a JSON file. As a result, the complete parameterization of a Modia Model, or the complete Modia model itself, can be exchanged in a straightforward way with a Web App for model composition by drag-and-drop and for 3D animation.\r\n\r\nHilding Elmqvist: Mogram AB\r\nMartin Otter, Andrea Neumayr, Gerhard Hippmann: DLR Institute of System Dynamics and Control",

  "description": "Data comes in many and diverse forms, and often it needs to be\r\ntransformed before modeling.

  "description": "The role of cell-cell communication in cell fate decision-making has not been well-characterized through a dynamical systems perspective. To do so, here we develop multiscale models that couple cell-cell communication with cell-internal gene regulatory network dynamics. This allows us to study the influence of external signaling on cell fate decision-making at the resolution of single cells. We study the granulocyte-monocyte vs. megakaryocyte-erythrocyte fate decision, dictated by the GATA1-PU.1 network, as an exemplary bistable cell fate system. Using JuliaLang, we model the cell-internal dynamics with nonlinear ordinary differential equations and the cell-cell communication via a Poisson process. \r\n\r\nIn this work, through analysis of a wide range of cell-cell communication topologies, we discovered that general principles emerged describing how cell-cell communication regulates cell fate decision-making. We studied a wide range of cell communication topologies through simulation using tools from DifferentialEquations.jl. We also used our high-performance computing cluster to run thousands of simulations in order to understand the limiting behaviors of our model. We show that, for a wide range of cell communication topologies, subtle changes in signaling can lead to dramatic changes in cell fate. We find that cell-cell coupling can explain how populations of heterogeneous cell types can arise. Analysis of intrinsic and extrinsic cell-cell communication noise demonstrates that noise alone can alter the cell fate decision-making boundaries. These results illustrate how external signals alter transcriptional dynamics, provide insight into cell fate decision-making, and provide a framework for modeling cell-cell communication that we expect will be of wide interest to the systems biology community.",

  "description": "High-content imaging screens provide a cost-effective and scalable way to assess cell states across diverse experimental conditions. The analysis of the acquired microscopy images involves assembling and curating morphological measurements of individual cells into morphological profiles suitable for testing biological hypotheses. Despite being a critical step, there is currently no standard approach to morphological profiling and no solution is available for the high-performance Julia programming language.\r\n\r\nHere, we introduce BioProfiling.jl, an efficient end-to-end solution for compiling and filtering informative morphological profiles in Julia. The package contains all the necessary data structures to curate morphological measurements and helper functions to transform, normalize and visualize profiles. Robust statistical distances and permutation tests enable quantification of the significance of the observed changes despite the high fraction of outliers inherent to high-content screens. This package also simplifies visual artifact diagnostics, thus streamlining a bottleneck of morphological analyses. We also showcase the features of the package by analyzing a chemical imaging screen, in which the morphological profiles prove to be informative about the compounds’ mechanisms of action and can be conveniently integrated with the network localization of molecular targets.\r\n\r\nIn this virtual poster, we will (i) present what BioProfiling.jl can do, (ii) discuss how to make it useful for more biological and scientific applications relying on curating tabular measurement data and (iii) consider how to improve its performance and reduce its external dependencies, aiming to make it a pure-Julia package.\r\n\r\nThe Julia package is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/menchelab/BioProfiling.jl). We also provide [Jupyter notebooks reproducing our analyses](https://github.com/menchelab/BioProfilingNotebooks).",

  "description": "In this virtual poster, I present the MitosisStochasticDiffEq.jl package (see https://github.com/mschauer/MitosisStochasticDiffEq.jl) for filtering and guiding of SDEs. Possible fields of application for these tools range from the control of the time evolution of the states of an SDE to the inference of the model parameters.\r\n\r\nMitosisStochasticDiffEq.jl implements the automatic Backward Filtering Forward Guiding (BFFG) paradigm [1,2] for programmable inference on latent states and model parameters in models described by stochastic differential equations. We start from a generative model that describes how the stochastic process evolves forward and how (potentially noisy and indirect) observations are generated from the process. In Backward Filtering Forward Guiding the information provided by those observations is backpropagated through the model to transform the generative (forward) model into a pre-conditional model guided by the data. This pre-conditioned SDE model approximates the actual (intractable) conditional model with known likelihood-ratio between the two.\r\n\r\nHaving this guided generative model at hand allows one to sample efficiently latent states and parameters conditional on observations. Since the BFFG paradigm can be formulated in terms of a set of transformation rules, it can be straightforwardly incorporated into a probabilistic programming context. The MitosisStochasticDiffEq package is based on the SciML ecosystem and thus it automatically integrates high-performing and specialized SDE solvers, sensitivity analysis tools, as well as distributed, multithreaded, and GPU parallel ensemble simulations. \r\n\r\nI demonstrate the workflow on the challenging study of parameter inference on a stochastic trait evolution model on a phylogenetic tree, which may be used to model the evolutionary relationships between biological species. \r\n\r\nCo-authors:\r\n\r\nFrank van der Meulen, Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics (DIAM), Delft University of Technology\r\nMoritz Schauer, Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Marcin Mider, Moritz Schauer, Frank van der Meulen (2020): Continuous-discrete smoothing of diffusions. arxiv:1712.03807.\r\n[2] Frank van der Meulen, Moritz Schauer (2020): Automatic Backward Filtering Forward Guiding for Markov processes and graphical models. arXiv:2010.03509.",

  "description": "Julia is a natural choice for computational chemists and materials scientists, primarily due to its excellent computational performance combined with ease of code sharing and extensibility within and between packages. Unsurprisingly, interest in and use of Julia within this community is growing – in particular, at JuliaCon 2020, several packages were introduced (such as JuliaChem and DFTK) that generated substantial “buzz” in the community, and despite being quite young (O(1) developer-year of invested effort), these packages are already matching or even exceeding best-in-class performance for some use cases!\r\n\r\nThis BoF session aims to continue this momentum, as well as to set some longer-term goals and norms for the community as a whole. To our knowledge, there has not yet been a broad discussion of this kind, and an informal proposal on Julia Discourse (see discourse.julialang.org/t/interest-in-chemistry-focused-bof ) indicated enthusiasm from a variety of developers and users.\r\n\r\nIn particular, at present, standards such as how to represent certain ubiquitous types of data and perform common tasks is lacking, which can lead to inadvertent duplication of effort. As interest in and use of Julia in these communities grows, the impact of establishing such norms multiplies. In this session, we plan to host a community discussion aimed at building consensus around these topics. Some specific examples include, but are not necessarily limited to:\r\n\r\n1. I/O for common structure file types (e.g. .cif, .xyz) and Julia data types for representing these structures (examples of Python versions of such systems include those provided by the Atomic Simulation Environment and pymatgen)\r\n2. Frequently-invoked mathematical procedures such as integration on common types of grids or using common sets of basis functions utilized within quantum chemical simulation approaches such as density functional theory and (post-)Hartree-Fock\r\n3. Julia bindings for widely-used codes in other languages (primarily C, C++, and Python) that are not worth duplicating in Julia in the short term but which provide functionality such as parsing outputs of simulation codes as well as some of the mathematical operations described above.\r\n\r\nWe are optimistic that the discussions in this session will both help to strengthen ties within this small but growing community as well as help to amplify its productivity and impact!",

  "description": "Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations require a potential energy function to describe the force field governing the interaction among atoms. Force calculation often takes between 50% and 90% of the overall complexity, thus, determining an adequate potential is a crucial task. Classical MD simulations use Empirical Potentials (EP), such as Lennard-Jones or Tersoff, and Machine Learning Potentials (MLP), such as Neural Network Potentials (NNP) or Spectral Neighborhood Analysis Potentials (SNAP). Despite their success, some potentials present limitations when solving complex study cases as ultrahigh temperature ceramics in hypersonic flows. Particularly, existing EP, ReaxFF and COMB, do not produce satisfactory results since they require retraining, while MLP demand a significant amount of Density Functional Theory (DFT) data for the training process. Coupling both potentials is a promising approach for reducing the amount of training data, leveraging physics information coded in the EP. Currently, there are no open-source libraries that allow this coupling and at the same time offer other key features, such as quantifying uncertainties in the trained MLP or identifying near-optimal configurations to include in the training data. MDP.jl, the Julia library of MD potentials, is being developed to fill this gap, aiming to provide fast and accurate potentials for classical MD simulations on exascale supercomputers. In this talk, the latest developments in MDP.jl regarding the descriptors and force field calculation are presented.",

  "description": "While the bus factor may be one of the most popular (and organizationally political) metrics in open source software development, it is only a partial view of package community health, and often interpreted without regard to community anti-patterns like gatekeeping. Julia is unique in the extent of its use of GitHub as the user interface and ‘operating system’ for Julia package development. Good package infrastructure alone, however, does not guarantee healthy communities. Julia’s package infrastructure and particularly its use of git and GitHub, mean that data about the package development process and package (as well as maintainer) dependency structures is available in unusual quality and granularity. I propose a new piece of ‘community infrastructure’ with which the Julia community can introspect, defined shared metrics and goals, and via which the economics of open source, in particular incentive misalignments like topic squatting, contributor churn, and zombie packages might be explored quantitatively.",

  "description": "We will show how Julia allows us to implement spatial branch-and-bound-type methods using interval arithmetic in parallel on GPUs, in a relatively painless way. \r\n\r\nThese methods use repeated bisection in a divide-and-conquer style to perform exhaustive search over a box in d dimensions (for small d), in order to find all roots of a function f, find all global optima of f, or to bound feasible sets of constraints such as {x: f(x) ≤ 0}.\r\n\r\nUsing a vectorised implementation, we will show firstly how to define a vector of interval objects (or similar user-defined types) on the GPU, which most other systems cannot do. Then we need a way to run interval arithmetic methods, as defined in the IntervalArithmetic.jl package, on the GPU.  `CUDA.jl`'s broadcasting abstraction \r\n\r\nWe will illustrate with the Griewank function, a standard test case for nonlinear optimization. We have  developed a generic implementation of a vectorised branch-and-prune algorithm, which can run on both the CPU and GPU with no code changes whatsoever. A key difficulty that we faced, but were able to solve, was how to eliminate the uninteresting boxes in parallel.\r\n\r\nWe obtain a 2-orders-of-magnitude speed-up over a single CPU core, and we expect that performance will be improved even more by reducing array allocations.",
