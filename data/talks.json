  "description": "My career and contributions have been greatly influenced by Alan Edelman’s work on random matrices, optimization, scientific computing, along with his cherished collaboration and advice. This talk starts with a brief survey of how Alan and his ideas provide a strong foundation for applied research in important areas: random matrices and optimization are applied extensively in diverse fields from sensor arrays to social media networks. The recent, interwoven developments of networked multimedia content sharing and neural-network-based large language and diffusion models would appear to provide a natural home for this theory, which has a great deal to say about the underlying matrices and algorithms that describe both the data and nonlinear optimization methods used in AI. Yet progress in these AI fields has evolved rapidly and spectacularly almost wholly without explicit insights from matrix theory, in spite of their deep reliance on random matrices. The second part of the talk uses related experience from recent work on MCMC- and LLM-based causal inference of real-world network influence to describe the challenges and potential opportunities of applying matrix theory to these recent developments.",

  "description": "The Julia language enables rapid progress even with a small number of software developers, as evidenced by its rich ecosystem, which makes it a great language for startups building a product based on state-of-the-art technologies drawing from advanced mathematical concepts. However, there are challenges in building a serverless web application, notably regarding hosting, packaging and serving the final product with minimal latency.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present a few of our development practices and our experience with using Julia to build a web service. Firstly, we will present the benefits of using a monorepo with a substantial number of submodules in a fully-remote distributed team. \r\n\r\nSecondly, we show how we organised our pipelines on GitLab and how we keep everything as fast as possible to ensure testing consistency and prompt developer feedback. We address the challenges in doing multiple daily deployments that are dependent on time consuming custom system image builds, as well as in identifying and debugging issues.\r\n\r\nThirdly, we show our use of several specialised docker and system images, which combined with several unregistered packages poses additional challenges in dependency management. \r\n\r\nTo conclude our talk, we introduce an open source project that can be used as a starting point to implement Julia web services that can be deployed to AWS Lambda.",

  "description": "Compressed sensing is used in numerous applications from medical imaging, network tomography, radio astronomy, recommendation systems to name a few.\r\n\r\nThis talk focuses on applying compressed sensing to Magnetic Resonance Imaging as an example. Several algorithms will be discussed including singular value thresholding, total variation denoising and wiener filtering. I will highlight how Julia libraries were used to rapidly prototype algorithms, experiments and explore key mathematical / optimization methods that can be readily applied by the practitioner.\r\n\r\nJulia has made it easy to apply common linear algebra subroutines such as the SVD and libraries exist to perform key tasks. These include:\r\n(i) reading in .h5 data used to store MRI images in k-space using HDF5.jl,\r\n(ii) to perform the IFFT (Inverse Fast Fourier Transform) using FFTW.jl,\r\n(iii) generate noise and perform some digital signal processing routines using Noise.jl and Deconvolution.jl respectively.\r\nThe relevant libraries and methodologies and how they fit into an overall data processing architecture will be discussed in this presentation.\r\n\r\nA demonstration will be performed on how Pluto.jl is used to communicate results and visualize MRI imagery using Plots.jl. Pluto.jl is a great tool especially for testing out imaging parameters that achieve a desirable result.\r\n\r\nThe talk describes how one takes an equation, implements it in Julia, imports data and visualizes results in 30 mins. It is highly appropriate to a diverse audience of engineers, applied mathematicians and scientists alike that don’t have time and need to understand how to apply compressed sensing to their problem in Julia.",

Meta analysis is an important technique of data analysis and is widely used in health and medicine for generation of evidence, and it is pivotal technique for evidence based health and widely used in other fields (economics, environmental health, and social sciences among other fields). Julia till date does not have a dedicated package for meta analysis and this package will fill this important gap in the Julia packages database.\r\nI have developed a Julia based meta-analysis package and it is in early alpha and I am testing it with my colleagues and students before release. The meta analysis package is written in Julia using a range of other existing packages and implements the meta-analysis techniques described in leading texts. It includes the following features: meta-analysis of single variables, meta-analysis of comparative studies; fixed-effects, random-effects meta analysis that implements DerSimonian-Laird Method and REML methods; testing for heterogeneity; forest and funnel plots; regression tests for publication bias; sensitivity analyses and meta-regression, and multilevel meta-analysis. This package will enable users to conduct meta-analysis of binary variables, continuous variables, time to event, \r\nIn the presentation, I will present the functions, packages, discuss codes, and experiences in building the package. I will also provide several examples of graphs and different types of data sets. The presentation will end with plans for future developments, and setting up a user community. The presentation will serve as a demonstration and a tutorial on meta-analysis.",

  "description": "[MINDFul.jl](https://github.com/UniStuttgart-IKR/MINDFul.jl) is an effort to provide the scientific networking community with a flexible, easy-to-use tool aimed at state-of-the-art research in the algorithmic control and architecture of multi-domain IP-Optical networks. The tool offers interfaces to integrate novel mechanisms into the package and an easy way to evaluate them with event-based simulations.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the presentation is dedicated to clearly explaining some necessary networking terms and notions. We will introduce the ideas behind Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Intent-Based Networking (IBN). We will talk about multi-domain and IP-Optical networks, which are globally used to enable data transfer and constitute the core of today's Internet.\r\n\r\nAfterward, we will describe the architecture of MINDFul.jl, and how a network domain can be represented using [NestedGraphs.jl](https://github.com/UniStuttgart-IKR/NestedGraphs.jl).\r\nIn short, MINDFul.jl leverages the common IBN architecture by positioning the IBN framework on top of the SDN controller. In addition, a novel flexible technique is introduced for handling network intents in decentralized multi-domain scenarios.\r\nWe will mention some of the interfaces, like how to add a connectivity intent into an IBN framework instance, compile it down to a concrete implementation, and install it in the simulated network.\r\n\r\nLater we will demonstrate the package usage and conduct a simple event-based simulation. The event-based simulation will be configured to enable link faults and repairs following an exponential distribution to showcase the influence on the connectivity intents' state. We will develop a simplistic heuristic algorithm, which we will integrate into the simulation. We can retrieve the data using the logs to evaluate the heuristic algorithm. In this stage, we will also show how to produce some visualizations using [MINDFulMakie.jl](https://github.com/UniStuttgart-IKR/MINDFulMakie.jl).\r\n\r\nWe will end the presentation with future directions, plans, and a discussion of how the networking community could benefit from such a tool and the promising role of Julia in this field.\r\n\r\nMINDFul.jl source code and documentation can be found in this repository: https://github.com/UniStuttgart-IKR/MINDFul.jl.\r\nSome notebook examples can be found here: https://github.com/UniStuttgart-IKR/MINDFulNotebookExamples.jl.",

  "description": "In Constraint Programming, a problem can be modeled as simply as\r\n- a set of variables' domains\r\n- a set of predicates over those variables called constraints\r\n- an optional objective\r\n\r\nOften, efficient solvers expect more complex models to provide additional efficiency. For instance, Constraint-Based Local Search (CBLS) solvers have significant speedups when the constraint is encoded as a more refined function than a predicate. We designed *CompositionalNetworks.jl* to learn those functions from simple predicates, effectively removing the modeling complexity.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, we designed *QUBOConstraints.jl* such that QUBO matrices are learned from simple predicates. Among other things, QUBO encoding can be used on QUBO based solvers and quantum annealing machines.\r\n\r\nFinally, **ConstraintLearning.jl** provides a common interface for both learning techniques. It also effectively allows both packages to only contains minimal data structures and generic solving interfaces to be including in appropriate solvers.",

  "description": "# Model\r\nAssuming a set of `n` points `V` in a `d`-dimensional space, we partition the space into regular hierarchical bins. The resulting data structure is a sparse tree `T` with, at most, `2^d` child nodes per node and a maximum depth of `L`.\r\n\r\n## Normalization\r\nThe given set of points `V` is mapped into a `d`-dimensional unit hypercube via an affine transformation that scales and translates `V` resulting in `Vn`.\r\n\r\n## Binning\r\nWe split each dimension of the unit hypercube in half and recursively continue splitting each resulting hypercube in the same manner. Each partition is called a bin. The subdivision stops at a maximum depth `L` or when a bin contains `k` or fewer points. The recursive splitting process is recorded as a hierarchical tree data structure.\r\n\r\n## 1D Encoding\r\nWe use Morton encoding to map the `d`-dimensional set `Vn` to a one-dimensional space-filling curve. Each point in `Vn` is assigned an index in the reduced space resulting in `R`. Elements of `R` are bit-fields, each one consisting of `L` groups of `d` bits. These groups describe the position of the point in the corresponding level of the tree `T`. Points described by morton indices with equal most signifficant digits belong in the same bin. Thus, sorting `R` results in `Rs` which defines the sparse tree.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\nCache-locality and parallel programming are some of the techniques we used, to make our implementation performant.\r\n\r\n## Cache locality\r\nCache locality offers fast memory access that greatly improves the performance of our algorithm.\r\n\r\n- The set of points `V`, and by extension `Vn`, is defined as a `Matrix` of size `(d, n)`. The leading dimension describes the number of dimensions in the hyperspace resulting in an access pattern that is more friendly to the cache since all points of `V` have their corresponding coordinates densely packed in memory.\r\n\r\n- Sorting `R` and `Vn` offers a memory layout that is cache-friendly. Since we access `V` through the `T` tree, we only access points that are in the same bin. `Rs` describes a bin of `T` with a contiguous block of memory, thus preserving cache-locality.\r\n\r\n- `T` is not a linked-tree. `T` is a tree stored densely in memory as a `Vector{Node}`. Each `Node` of `T` is aware of their children and parent using their indices in this dense `Vector{Node}`.\r\n\r\n## Parallel Partial Sorting\r\nThe Morton curve bit-field denotes the tree node of each point. The partial sorting using the Most Significant Digit (MSD) radix-sort, places the points to the corresponding bins. Points that fall within the same leaf node do not get sorted. The radix-sort runs in parallel: the partition of digits is done with a parallel count-sort, and then each digit subset is processed independently in parallel.\r\n\r\n## Adaptive Tree\r\nEmpty bins, that is, nodes that do not contain any points, are not stored or referenced explicitly.\r\n\r\n\r\n# References\r\n- Sun, X., & Pitsianis, N.

  "description": "This section will introduce our process for selecting cloud service providers and data sources, compare various system backend implementations, and conclude with a system evaluation. \r\n\r\n**Reasons for AWS cloud**\r\n\r\nInitially, we deployed our program on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud because it offers scalable data storage and can handle concurrent requests from multiple customers/agents. Among the leading cloud service providers (such as Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud), AWS is currently the market leader and provides one-third of the world's cloud infrastructure services.\r\n\r\n**Data Source**\r\n\r\nWe chose [Polygon](https://polygon.io/) as the data source for our data feed, and particularly, their WebSocket data feed mechanism. Polygon is a leading financial market data platform that supplies market data for stocks, options, futures, and cryptocurrencies. Their aggregated data have up to a second resolution. \r\n\r\n**Key implementation**\r\n\r\nThe backend, the main part of this talk, was implemented in Julia using existing packages. We explored two ways to do this; the first is to use various AWS services via [AWS.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCloud/AWS.jl), [LambdaMaker.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCloud/LambdaMaker.jl), etc. Those packages provide different microservices to build up our system. The second approach was to set up EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud) instances and deploy the program to these instances. The first approach was the easiest to develop but strongly depended on AWS solutions. For example, we used DynamoDb (an AWS NoSQL database service) to store real-time market data for certain tickers. However, if Amazon shuts down DynamoDb or migrates to another service, we must make changes accordingly. Hence the second approach is not constrained by particular Amazon services;  it requires virtual machines to be configured by users and does not lead to vendor lock-in issues.\r\n\r\nAs for the frontend, we display real-time data from the data source. This component was constructed as a Typescript React App.\r\n\r\nThe following diagram describes how the frontend client/user interacts with the backend AWS services.\r\n\r\n**Evaluations**\r\n\r\nWe considered several key factors when evaluating the real-time data storage system: latency, scalability, accuracy, reliability, and throughput. Of these, scalability and throughput may be influenced by our choice of cloud service. We have preliminary implemented the first backend using AWS solutions, and the frontend is a React application deployed on AWS Amplify service. The frontend does not have a limit on concurrency but has some constraints such as total data transfer, request duration, and the total number of requests in the free tier. We will be able to determine which one reaches the limit first after building the frontend features. Our backend service DynamoDB has limitations on concurrency, which is 25 read requests per second. If we consider each request of historical data requires one read from the database, our free tier supports a maximum of 25 concurrent requests at the same time.\r\n\r\nLatency can be measured in various ways, including end-to-end latency and processing latency. End-to-end latency measures the time taken from a request to be made to a response to be received. In this scenario, it measures the data processing time from start to finish for a given ticker. We have implemented the backend with various AWS solutions, and despite some spike processing time of up to 2,000ms to 4,000ms, the average data processing time is now 100-200ms. Processing latency, on the other hand, measures the time it takes for the system to process a specific input or request. In this scenario, it measures the steps of backend data processing: storing a ticker data in the database and notifying the client in real-time. The average processing time for storing a ticker data is 30ms to 100ms, while notifying the client in real-time is 70ms to 120ms. We will also be able to evaluate the \"real-time\" performance of our system using these two different backend implementations once the second implementation is completed.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the accuracy and reliability of our system, we need to consistently provide correct and current data in an optimized way, especially in the face of client changes or malicious attacks. Our backend system should be able to handle and optimize for these scenarios without being affected.",

  "description": "Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are valuable tools for a broad range of fields, including Economics and Social Science, enabling the evaluation of the economic and social impact of various environmental policies. They rely on scientific computing to analyze and understand complex and dynamic systems. We present WorldDynamics.jl, an open-source Julia package that allows the development and reproduction of IAMs using modern scientific computing techniques. In this workshop, we are going to interactively demonstrate the main functionalities of WorldDynamics.jl to the Julia community while guiding the audience with comprehensive hands-on examples.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the package reproduces the whole family of system dynamics models, from Jay Forrester's WORLD1 to the recent Earth4All, including the notable WORLD3, which was reimplemented directly from the DYNAMO code to Julia. Using the ModelingToolkit structure, each model is treated as a collection of subsystems, which are self-contained ODESytem with their own parameters, variables, and equations. All subsystems are connected into a single system, which forms the complete model, with interactions represented as a system of differential equations and solved using DifferentialEquations.jl and ModelingToolkit.jl. This modular structure allows us to play with subsystems individually and combine them in different ways into a unique model with little effort. Besides the original models, it is also straightforward to add existing updated versions as an extension, which exemplifies how a user is able to create their own update from a well-known model.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we are going to present the package functionalities with hands-on examples using several of the currently available models. Initially, we start with a general explanation of the package, emphasizing how it is being developed. Subsequently, we proceed with the major demonstration of the package's main features via practical coding cases, including the reproduction of the original figures from implemented historical models using PlotJS.jl. We also show how to alter the values of parameters, tables, and edit equations of models, leveraging the package modular approach to combine different subsystems in ways that were not easily achievable previously. Finally, we present the development roadmap, which includes current works under construction, our expectations for the near future, and what we intend to achieve in the next major releases.\r\n\r\nAfter the workshop, we expect the audience will be able to have a clear comprehension of current WorldDynamics.jl capabilities and functionalities. Along with this talk, we are also submitting a talk proposal to present the motivation and goals behind the package, to share the model development process, and the challenges we face.",

  "description": "The presentation is aimed at anyone with a basic understanding of gradient-based optimization or with an interest in trust-region methods and surrogate modeling. That is because many of the concepts in our multi-objective setting are generalizations of well-known single-objective pendants.\r\nLike in single-objective optimization, optimization problems with multiple objectives and nonlinear constraint functions might arise in a multitude of areas in the natural sciences, engineering, or economics. Whereas trust-region ideas allow for a relatively straightforward modeling of objective functions to design derivative-free descent algorithms, they cannot handle “difficult” constraint functions without modifications. But the composite-step approach and the Filter mechanism can be adapted from single-objective optimization, enabling the same modeling techniques for constraints as well. Now it is possible to use suitable, “fully linear” models, such as linear polynomials or radial basis function models, to achieve convergence to first-order critical points, without gradient queries for the true functions. \r\nIn our pre-print (https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12094), we refer to a prototype implementation in a Pluto notebook. This proof-of-concept uses JuMP and COSMO to find the inexact steps. Moreover, we currently use NLopt for nonlinear restoration and Makie for plotting. Our main goal, at the moment, is to package the algorithm and integrate it with the SciML ecosystem for nonlinear optimization. We hope to benefit from existing solutions, such as automatic differentiation or symbolic manipulations. For example, we currently investigate the possibility of only modeling subcomponents of a symbolically defined function. Of course, we hope to be able to provide a glimpse of this, too.",

  "description": "Ensuring a certain level of reliability becomes challenging with renewable-powered and decentralized energy systems. \r\nThe problem is increasingly relevant for energy system dispatch planning, both in cases of advanced grid infrastructure or of severe resource-constraints. The capability of a local unit of balancing its supply and demand successfully becomes crucial, when the availability of a higher-level grid-balancing unit is unreliable.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I explain how this unreliability can be considered using Joint Chance Constraints and will introduce how these are implemented in JuMP optimization models. By comparing these models to both deterministic and Individual Chance Constrained programming problems, I prove that Joint Chance Constraints help increase the reliability of the microgrids and their successful operation in the \"islanded\" mode.\r\n\r\nThe library was conceived for the application described above, but is written generically such that it can be applied for other similarly-structured problems.",

  "description": "Julia SciML is a collection of hundreds of scientific computing packages for the Julia programming language. Historically, SciML began as a group of fast ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers. However, in the last half a decade, SciML has grown to include an extensive collection of packages geared toward modern scientific computing, with its own Computer Algebra System (CAS) and Domain Specific Language (DSL), the ability for heterogeneous computing (e.g., running code on GPUs), and seamless connection to machine learning packages.\r\n\r\nJulia SysBio community has significantly benefited from the SciML ecosystem. One of the first efforts to make SciML usable to the SysBio community was to provide importers and bridging packages (e.g., CellMLToolkit.jl, SBMLToolkit.jl) that allow for standard and well-curated models in open-source repositories (CellML, SBML) to be imported and used by the SciML packages. CellML models are generally in the form of ODE and are usually solved with the help of ODE and partial differential equation (PDE) solvers. On the other hand, SBML models are usually presented as reaction networks and are better suited to Catalyst.jl.\r\n\r\nWith the maturation of the SciML infrastructure and the availability of bridging packages between the biological models and the SciML ecosystem, it is time for applications! In this mini-symposium, we showcase some recent applications of SciML in SysBio in academia and industry.\r\n\r\nIn addition to presenting various applications, our plan is to have a forum to provide feedbacks from the community to the core SciML developers in order to guide the future development of SciML and related packages to make Julia and SciML the best environment for SysBio applications. \r\n\r\nPresenters:\r\n\r\n* Alex Cohen will be presenting on techniques for learning physically-constrained models in mode space to characterize the locomotion and behavioral states of animals that use undulatory locomotion. \r\n\r\n* Shahriar Iravanian will be presenting simulating cardiac electrophysiological ionic models as 2D/3D PDEs with the help of Julia and SciML and showcase the power of composition in Julia by using dual complex numbers in CUDA kernels to solve a biological problem (calculating the membrane impedance of cardiac cells).\r\n\r\n* Torsten Schenkel/Harry Saxton will be presenting lumped parameter models We introduce CirculatorySystemModels.jl (CSM), an acausal model library built on ModelingToolkit.jl, containing a wide range of cardiovascular elements for creating complex models. CSM provides a common API, with automatic generation of ODEs meaning every 0D model can be solved with the same workflow, allowing for full integration with the SciML framework.\r\n\r\n* Katy Norman (Sanofi) will be presenting how Julia and SciML tools are used in QSP modeling teams at Sanofi. \r\n\r\n* Otto Ritter (Merck) will be presenting how Julia, Applied Category Theory, and SciML tools are used in QSP modeling teams at Merck with ReactiveDynamics.jl. \r\n\r\n* Sam Isaacson will be discussing high level progression of the systems biology ecosystem in Julia, providing important context on future steps and ways that the community can improve and collaborate.\r\n\r\n* Don Elbert will be presenting on variable volume models and his experience as a SciML user. This will provide important context on pain points for adoption and what we can do to make Julia the primary choice for modeling and simulation of biology.\r\n\r\n* Wiktor Phillips will be presenting his acausal neuronal modeling and simulation package, Conductor.jl.\r\n\r\n* Joe Bender (United Therapeutics) will be presenting how Julia and SciML tools are used in QSP modeling teams at United Therapeutics.  \r\n\r\n* Torkel Loman will be presenting Catalyst.jl and how chemical reaction networks are simulated in Julia.",

  "description": "One of the important application areas for Julia lies in statistics. Dataset sizes have exploded, thus creating demands on high performance. In addition, there are elegant possibilities to harness the language foundations of Julia to create useful abstractions and better code reuse. In this mini-symposium, we report on some of this progress. The minisymposium will feature:\r\n\r\n1. Survey.jl: a package for studying complex survey data (Ayush Patnaik)\r\n\r\nHandling complex survey data is a crucial task in statistics, requiring the incorporation of survey design to accurately estimate standard errors associated with survey estimates. While established software such as SAS, STATA, and SUDAAN provide this capability, the survey package in R is a popular open-source option. However, as dataset sizes grow, the need for a more efficient computing framework arises. This talk introduces the Survey package in Julia, which aims to address this need.\r\nThis talk provides an overview of surveys and survey design, emphasizing the importance of accounting for survey design when estimating standard errors. It explores design-based standard errors and various methods to estimate them accurately. The presentation then delves into the implementation details and design choices of the Survey package in Julia.\r\n\r\n2. Lessons learned from doing introductory econometrics with GLM.jl (Bogumil Kaminski)\r\n\r\nGLM.jl is a fast and easy to use package, allowing its users to estimate generalized linear regression models.\r\nAs a researcher in economics, Bogumil explored if the package had sufficient functionality for a standard introductory econometrics course. He implemented all examples contained in Part 1 (chapters 1 to 9) of “Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach”, Seventh Edition textbook by Jeffrey M. Wooldridge.\r\nIn the talk, he shares his experience of the process, in particular discussing the missing functionalities.\r\nThe talk is accompanied by the GitHub repository containing all the source codes for all the exercises and custom functions that fill all the gaps I found.\r\nThe codes are ready to use by introductory econometrics teachers in their classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. CRRao.jl: A consistent API for many useful models (Sourish Das)\r\n\r\nHere is the abstract: CRRao.jl is built as a single API for diverse statistical models. Drawing inspiration from the Zelig package in the R world, the CRRao package provides a simple and consistent API for end-users. In this talk, we will present how to implement Bayesian Analysis with the Horse-Shoe Prior using CRRao.jl. We will demonstrate how the Poisson regression model can be implemented for the English Premier League dataset, using Ridge prior, Laplace prior, Cauchy prior, and Horse-Shoe prior. Furthermore, we will show how Logistic Regression with the Horse-Shoe prior can be implemented using the Friedrich Ataxia dataset from Genome research. Additionally, we will illustrate how Gaussian Process Regression can be implemented using the CRRao API call.\r\n\r\n4. Improving the precision GLM (Mousum Dutta)\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will explore the impact of different decomposition methods on Generalized Linear Models (GLM). The presentation will be divided into the following sections:\r\n\r\ni. Overview of GLM (5 mins): A brief introduction to Generalized Linear Models, a statistical framework used for diverse response variables.\r\nii. Understanding Decomposition Methods in GLM (3 mins)\r\niii. Comparison of Cholesky and QR Decompositions (5 mins): Highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in GLM estimation.\r\niv. Improving Numerical Stability with QR Decomposition (7 mins): Exploring how QR decomposition can enhance numerical stability in GLM estimation.\r\nv. Performance Advantage of Cholesky Decomposition (3 mins)\r\nvi. Conclusions (2 mins)\r\n\r\nThis will be a simplified version of the Statistics in Julia symposium that was in Juliacon 2022 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fewunew8wU4). It reflects the areas in which good new work has happened in the past year. Of course, the material in the minisymposium will be self-contained: it will target a new viewer, it will not be produced as a diff on the previous one.",

At a high level, MagNav.jl provides tooling to compensate for an aircraft’s magnetic field, removing most of the corruption to enable comparing magnetometer readings with detailed maps of the Earth’s magnetic field. It can then use the resultant signal, alongside other readings, as input to a navigation filter, such as an extended Kalman filter, in order to estimate position. Julia is integral to our research in this field due to its specialties in automatic differentiation, ease of neural network construction, and its performance.

  "description": "In this talk, I will discuss the DataToolkit*.jl family of packages, which aim\r\nto enable end-to-end robust treatment of data. The small number of other\r\nprojects that attempt to tackle subsets of data management —DataLad, the Kedro\r\ndata catalogue, Snakemake, Nextflow, Intake, Pkg.jl's Artifacts, DataSets.jl—\r\nhave a collection of good ideas, but all fall short of the convenience and\r\nrobustness that is possible.\r\n\r\nPoor data management practices are rampant. This has been particularly visible\r\nwith computational pipelining tools, and so most have rolled their own data\r\nmanagement systems (Snakemake, Nextflow, Kedro). These may work well when\r\nbuilding/running computational pipelines, but are harder to use interactively;\r\nbesides which, not everything is best expressed as a computational pipeline.\r\n\r\nScientific research is another area where robust data management is vitally\r\nimportant, yet often doesn't follow one or more of the FAIR principles\r\n(findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable). For this domain, a more general\r\napproach is needed than is offered by computational pipeline tools. DataLad and\r\nIntake both represent more general solutions, however both also fall short in\r\nmajor ways. DataLad lacks any sort of declarative data file (embedding info as\r\nJSON in git commit messages), and while Intake has a (YAML — see\r\nhttps://noyaml.com for why this isn't a great choice) data file format it only\r\nprovides read-only data access, making it less helpful for writing/publishing\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThere is space for a new tool, providing a better approach to data management.\r\nFurthermore, there are strong arguments for building such a tool with Julia, not\r\nleast due to the strong project management capabilities of Pkg.jl and the\r\nindependence from system state provided by JLL packages. An analysis performed\r\nin Julia, with the environment specified by a Manifest.toml, the data processing\r\ncaptured within the same project, and the input data itself verified by\r\nchecksumming, should provide a strong reproducibility guarantees — beyond that\r\neasily offered by existing tools. A data analysis project can be hermetic.\r\n\r\nOne of the aims of DataToolkit.jl is to make this not just possible, but easy to\r\nachieve. This is done by providing a capable \"Data CLI\" for working with the\r\nData.toml file. Obtaining and using a dataset is as easy as:\r\n\r\n    data> create iris https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv\r\n    julia> sum(d\"iris\".sepal_length) # do something with the data\r\n\r\nThis exercise generates a Data.toml file that declaratively specifies the data\r\nsets of a project, how they are obtained and verified, and even capture the\r\npreprocessing required before the main analysis. DataToolkit.jl provides a\r\ndeclarative data catalogue file, easy data access, and automatic validation;\r\nenabling data management in accordance with the FAIR principles.\r\n\r\nPkg.jl's Artifact system also provides these reproducibility guarantees, but is\r\ndesigned specifically for small blobs of data required by packages. This shows\r\nin the design, with a number of crippling caveats for general usage, such as:\r\nthe maximum file size of 2GB, only working with libcurl downloads (i.e. no GCP\r\nor S3 stored data, etc.), and being unextensible.\r\n\r\nEven if DataToolkit.jl works well in some situations, to provide a truly general\r\nsolution it needs to be able to adapt to unforeseen use cases — such as custom\r\ndata formats/access methods, and integration with other tools. To this end,\r\nDataToolkit.jl also contains a highly flexible plugin framework that allows for\r\nthe fundamental behaviours of the system to be drastically altered. Several\r\nmajor components of DataToolkit.jl are in fact provided as plugins, such as the\r\ndefault value, logging, and memorisation systems.\r\n\r\nWhile there is some overlap between DataToolkit.jl and DataSets.jl,\r\nDataToolkit.jl currently provides a superset of the capabilities (for instance\r\nthe ability to express composite data sets, built from multiple input data sets)\r\nwith more features in development; and the design of DataToolkitBase.jl allows\r\nfor much more to be built on it.\r\n\r\nThe current plan for the talk itself is:\r\n- An overview of the problem domain and background\r\n- A description of the DataToolkit.jl family of packages\r\n- A demonstration or example of using DataToolkit.jl\r\n- Showing what it takes to implement a new data loader/storage driver\r\n- An overview of the plugin system\r\n- A demonstration of the plugin system",

  "description": "This is a real development scenario that we encountered to preprocess 6-year, 16TB historical IoT raw datasets for data cleaning and transformation. It takes 100 days to complete processing in a single-machine environment, which is time-consuming.\r\nSo, the Falra.jl was developed to allow us to divide the data cleaning and transformation tasks that we need to perform into smaller tasks. Falra.jl then automatically distributes these tasks for distributed processing. This architecture saves a lot of computing time and development costs. Through Falra.jl, we were able to complete all IoT data transformations in 1/100 of the time. \r\n\r\nCompared to the native Julia distributed module, the advantage of Falra.jl is that developers do not need to learn how to develop the Julia distributed programming syntax. They can just use their single-machine programs as they used to do. In addition, Falra.jl can be deployed on any network that can be called via HTTPS. There is no need to deal with TCP or other network or firewall issues.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we've enhanced our approach by integrating AI-assisted Julia source code auto-generation. This novel feature allows developers to efficiently create Julia code using artificial intelligence. Rather than manually crafting each line of code, the AI\r\ncan generate source code based on the developer's requirements, thus accelerating the development process. It makes it feasible for developers, even those unfamiliar with Julia, to quickly produce distributed programs. This AI-driven tool not only simplifies code creation but also enables the rapid adaptation and extension of the\r\napplications under the Falra.jl . The fusion of distributed computing and AI-assisted auto-generation of Julia source code significantly boosts productivity.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have released the Falra.jl on Github (https://github.com/bohachu/Falra.jl) for everyone to use.",

  "description": "The identification of phase transitions and the classification of different phases of matter from data are among the most popular applications of machine learning (ML) in condensed matter physics. NN-based approaches have proven to be particularly powerful due to the ability of NNs to learn arbitrary functions. Many such approaches work by computing indicators of phase transitions from the output of NNs trained to solve specific classification problems. \r\n\r\nThe optimal solutions to these classification problems are given by Bayes classifiers that take into account the probability distributions underlying the physical system under consideration. We show that in many scenarios arising in (quantum) many-body physics, the Bayes optimal indicators can be well-approximated (or even computed exactly) based on readily available data by leveraging prior system knowledge. This constitutes an alternative approach to detecting phase transitions from data compared to NN-based classification. Here, we contrast these two approaches based on our Julia implementation.",

  "description": "There are two common paradigms for mathematical modelling of dynamics in life science: Knowledge-based mechanistic models like systems of ordinary differential equations or black-box approaches such as neural networks. Over the last years, methods for combining these concepts, sometimes called hybrid models, gained increasing attention in various fields of science. Neural universal differential equations (UDEs) represent one of the most prominent ideas. UDEs describe the dynamics of a system in the form of an ordinary differential equation (ODE), summing over a knowledge-based mechanistic term and a neural network-based universal approximator term. Since mechanistic parameters can jointly be optimized with the parameters of the neural network, UDEs raise hope to solve both forward as well as inverse problems with arbitrary levels of prior knowledge.\r\nUsing SciMLs DiffEqFlux.jl, we explore the applicability of UDEs for parameter estimation in the context of systems biology. For this, we consider different levels of noise, data sparsity, and prior knowledge about the underlying system on problems described by ordinary differential equations. The setting of systems biology introduces difficulties like observable mappings, high-dimensional mechanistic parameter spaces and stiffness. \r\nWe integrate ideas from conventional mechanistic modeling with ideas from neural network training to overcome these challenges and balance the contributions from knowledge-based mechanistic models and data-driven neural network components.",

  "description": "It allows the user to create in a few clicks a .geo file containing all the information for the open-source widely used GMSH software to create properly structured meshes. Before exporting the mesh, the user can visualize the preview, and modify almost all the parameters (number of divisions and or the growth ratio in the inlet, airfoil surface or shear ...) and see the new results in real-time. The package also adds the physical tag (inlet, outlet, airfoil and limits) to the entities relieving the workload from the user. The mesh created is compatible with the most popular CFD software (Fluent, STARCCM+). In reality, this package, was born to create airfoil meshes that are compatible with the FEM package Gridap.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this package is to create a .geo that can be read by GMSH. It has been decided to write a .geo file and not directly the .msh file for three main reasons. Firstly, the .geo file is easy to read and interpret. In this way, the user can perform some easy changes directly on it, without the need to dig deeply into the code. Secondly, it can be imported into GMSH, all the parameters can be modified so the user can visually verify that the mesh is good enough for its purpose. Lastly, the API of GMSH for Julia at the moment does not provide all the features that are needed. The package is simple but quite powerful, it provides basically only two functions:\r\n-\tfrom_url_to_csv: the user can browse on the airfoiltools.com website looking for the profile to analyze. It is the biggest database of airfoil online. As the name of the function suggests, it creates a .csv file where the airfoil points are stored. This function comes in handy when the user does not have the file with the points of the profile.\r\n-\tmain_create_geofile: is heart of the package. It allows to create the .geo file. Here its plenty of optional argument that the user can specify to achieve a results closer to his needs:\r\n- Reynolds number: this is used to compute the boundary layer characteristics over the airfoil. An optimal combination of meshing parameters is defined by employing some empiric formulas and setting some constraints on the number of cells in the boundary layer and the growth ratio. In the boundary layer, a sufficient number of cells is needed (at least 30 in a turbulent case), a growth ratio G between 1.05 and 1.2, and we have to ensure that y+ is approximately 1.\r\n- First layer height: sometimes this is the value that the user wants to ensure. Usually, it comes from previous simulations or other authors work.\r\n- Chord: is set c=1 by default, but this value can be overrided.\r\n- Dimensions: 2D or 3D.\r\n - Elements: TRI/TETRA or QUAD/HEXA, can be the shape of the single element.\r\nWe have not specified yet because this mesher is defined as \"smart\". As shows in the previous section, it automatically compute the optimal mesh characteristic requiring no additional work form the user. Furthermore, it is able to distinguish the trailing edge (rear part), the leading edge, the suction side (top part) and pressure side (bottom part). It automatically fixes two point close to the trailing edge, one on the suction and one on the pressure side, in order to create the inlet region.\r\n\r\nIt can detect the shape of the trailing edge, that can be sharp or not, and so the mesh will be different. Meshing the trailing edge has always been troublesome for engineers due to its strong curvatures and strange shapes. \r\n\r\nFor a 3D mesh, the user can specify the boundaries surfaces normal to x-axis to be periodic.\r\n\r\nThe mesh, once the .geo file is open in GMSH, is highly customizable. The user can specify the number of nodes in the inlet section, over the airfoil, over the vertical lines, in the shear, as well as the geometrical growth of the cells. The user can also define the length of the domain. Furthermore, it creates a refinement region close to the airfoil in order to customize the parameters to have a better-refined mesh.\r\nThe user can also specify the angle of attack of the profile, which is a fundamental parameters for evaluating airfoil performance. By default it is set to zero. Increasing the AoA leads the airfoil to rotate, as well as the shear and refinement mesh.\r\nClass Shape Transformation (CST) is also implemented. It allows increasing the number of points defining the profile.",

  "description": "The Extended Kalman filter (EKF) is a commonly-used recursive filter that finds use in sensor fusion and state estimation applications, like robotics and spacecraft control. The filter takes in noisy observations, compares them to a provided model, and updates an estimate of a system's state. A key part of the state update process is computing a state transition matrix, which can be become large when a large state or many observations are used. In systems with non-linear dynamics or observations, the elements of the matrix can be complicated expression. Julia's excellent symbolic manipulation capabilities can greatly simplify the generation of these matrices, speedy up development time of new EKFs. This approach has proven really useful at the satellite company where I work, providing a fun example of Julia in an enterprise setting.\r\n\r\nI wrote a package called TinyEKFGen to generate EKF matrices for use in satellite attitude estimation, but also for any other estimation system that is suited to Kalman filtering. The package takes in Julia code describing a system's state, dynamics, and measurements, and emits C code that works with the TinyEKF library. This code is then suitable for use on embedded systems that with limited memory or that don't allow dynamic allocation. In this talk I'll show how the TinyEKFGen code works and run through some examples Kalman filter programs, including a tumbling satellite!",

  "description": "GAMS, or General Algebraic Modelling System, is used extensively to solve economic optimization problems. Originally released in 1987, the language lacks many conveniences of a modern language such as case sensitivity. Julia JuMP is a natural successor to GAMS allowing for a complete model description, from data cleaning to solving a model to displaying the data. \r\n\r\nA large issue is converting GAMS users to Julia. GAMS has been in use for 35 years and the people that use GAMS are accustomed to the compact, self-documenting syntax that GAMS allows. To bridge this gap, we have created a Julia package called GamsStructure.jl. This package has been designed to emulate loading and manipulating data in GAMS, and has built in mechanisms to attach a description to Sets and Parameters. \r\n\r\nBeing an old language in heavy use GAMS has a rich library of examples and sample code to assist modelers in building complex models. We are working on translating many of these models into Julia and building a repository to share with the general community. We are also preparing a paper comparing the impacts of policing on tourism in Jamaica using both GAMS and Julia.",

  "description": "The community of Julia users in academic fields involving quantum phenomena and in the quantum computing industry continues to grow. There is already a vibrant ecosystem of quantum-related Julia packages and users and developers at a variety of career stages: high school, undergraduate, and graduate students; postdoctoral scholars; faculty; staff scientists; and industry researchers and developers. In these conjoined minisymposia, the community would be able to present their work to a quantum-focused audience, allowing package developers to present material more relevant to an expert audience (which is often not really appropriate for the wider JuliaCon audience), more junior community members to find mentors in their area, and allowing community members working in different areas to find areas of common interest or need.\r\n\r\nFor example, the minisymposium might contain a talk about tensor network methods in condensed matter physics, and another talk about these methods as applied to quantum circuit simulation, allowing developers in both areas to understand where current Julia implementations are lacking and find new contributors. Having a dedicated stream (minisymposia) for this kind of talk would facilitate this kind of interaction.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a quantum-focused series of minisymposia would allow the \"quantum curious\" -- students, those in industry but without a background in the relevant fields -- to see the \"lay of the land\" and find opportunities to contribute, for research, or for job searches.\r\n\r\nWe propose a double or conjoined minisymposium -- one session in the morning, one in the afternoon -- because of the breadth of the community and the wide variety of use cases and fields of study covered. Two sessions will allow us to include enough full length talks to treat each area fairly, as even with much background in common, a full length talk is often needed to treat a topic in the \"quantum\" area in sufficient depth. We also hope to solicit lightning talks from more junior members (e.g. graduate or undergraduate students).\r\n\r\nConfirmed speakers:\r\n\r\n    Matt Fishman & Miles Stoudenmire (ITensor.jl)\r\n    Katharine Hyatt (Amazon Braket)\r\n    QuEra computing\r\n\r\nOthers to reach out to:\r\n\r\n    Roger Melko (University of Waterloo/Perimeter Institute)\r\n    Amazon Center for Quantum Computing (Ash Milsted, Andrew Keller)\r\n    Zapata Computing\r\n    Paul Brehmer, RWTH Aachen University\r\n    Michael Goerz (QuantumControl.jl)",

  "description": "Imagine a busy scientist developing a numerical program P in Julia using a mix of code running on CPUs and offloaded GPU codes. Suppose the program runs to completion, but it has many NaNs (\"not a number\" in IEEE floating-point arithmetic) in the result.\r\n\r\nUnable to proceed meaningfully, the scientist resorts to printing out the NaNs by decoding the values (a hugely time-consuming \"hit-miss\" proposition). After weeks of work, they discover that one particular\r\ndivision operation within an inner Julia library function J and another sqrt() inside a GPU library function G are two sources of NaNs.\r\n\r\nProbing further, the scientist discovers that function J is called along two call paths P1 and P2. Path P1 conducts the NaN generated by function J to the output result. Path P2, on the other hand, goes through a Julia less-than (<) function that \"kills\" the NaN by silently consuming it in the computation.\r\n\r\nThe scientist decides to rewrite this function to conduct the NaN to the output (call it \"failure manifestation\" for debugging), but they are unsure if there is another call path P3 that also can be activated under a different input, and whether P3 might also kill the NaN sometimes.\r\n\r\nCurious about why function G generates NaN, the scientist seeks the CUDA sources for it; unfortunately, they discover that G is supplied by NVIDIA in binary form with no documentation.\r\n\r\nThe scientist now hears about OUR NEW TOOL FlowFPX---a unique contribution that has many attractive features:\r\n\r\n- (a) FlowFPX can run program P unmodified, and shows all the call-paths through the code impinging on functions J and G. Across the thousands of numerical iterations of code C, FlowFPX summarizes all the paths that cause J and G to GENERATE NaNs (gen), the paths that PROPAGATE NaNs (prop), and paths that KILL the NaNs (kill)---a much more comprehensive report that is generated automatically.\r\n\r\n- (b) FlowFPX even produces a nice graphical visualization of gen, prop, and kill.\r\n\r\n- (c) To find additional lurking paths such as P3, FlowFPX can induce stress by making any floating-point operator foo() artificially generate NaNs. This simulates an (as yet unseen) input which might have caused foo() to spit out a NaN. Using this facility, the scientist discovers ways to failure-manifest paths in program P paths.\r\n\r\n- (d) The scientist also discovers that FlowFPX comes with a companion tool called GPU-FPX that can examine binary-only GPU codes using NVIDIA-provided binary instrumentation. This way, if G internally generates a NaN but silently kills this NaN inside the code, the scientist can do one of two things: (i) see if NVIDIA provides an alternative implementation of G that helps failure-manifest. (ii) artificially generate a NaN at the return site of the G call even if G silently kills the NaN inside. This helps keep the program P more transparent and reliable in that internal NaNs are not lost during test runs.\r\n\r\nThe scientist then goes and reads the documentation of FlowFPX and finds these important facts that further makes them a fan of the FlowFPX tool:\r\n\r\n- (a) NaN-bugs are not rare. A recent bug-report is https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/sqrt-of-positive-number-is-nan-with-newer-drivers/219078/15.\r\n\r\n- (b) GPU-FPX is released at https://github.com/LLNL/GPU-FPX, and backed by a publication by PhD student Xinyi Li cited therein\r\n\r\n- (c) FlowFPX was inspired by Sherlogs.jl https://github.com/milankl/Sherlogs.jl that has been proven useful in examining Julia codes run on the Fugaku supercomputer.\r\n\r\n- (d) The study of floating-point exceptions is hugely important, and even for important libraries, there is disagreement on how to handle them, as discussed in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09281.pdf written by Demmel et al.",

  "description": "Optimal control, state estimation, and system identification are examples of dynamic optimization problems (DOPs). In general, these need to be discretized in time into finite-dimensional problems, suitable for optimization solvers.\r\n\r\nTranscribing DOPs into (nonlinear) optimization problems can be done in various ways. The state-of-the-art are direct collocation methods, where the differential equations are enforced at each of the discretized time nodes and the number of collocation points do not exceed the degrees of freedom. Integrated residual methods (IRMs) are a generalization of collocation, where errors in the differential equation violations are penalized instead. This generalization robustifies the method against certain DOPs for which the collocation method fails.\r\n\r\nWe parameterize the continuous trajectories using Lagrange polynomials in the barycentric form. This representation allows for fast and numerically stable interpolations. The user can choose the degree of polynomials, as well as the node distribution (e.g. Chebyshev, Legendre) to be used.\r\n\r\nA central part of IRMs is the integration of the dynamic constraints violation. The numerical integration is done using Gauss quadrature methods. The user can choose the degree of quadrature, as well as the distribution (e.g. Gauss-Legendre, Clenshaw-Curtis) to be used.\r\n\r\nThe transcribed optimization problem is solved with `Progradio.jl`, our projected gradient solver. Because the package implements Julia's `Iterator` interface, the optimization can be arbitrarily terminated by Interesso. This is a key feature which allows efficient mesh refinement.\r\n\r\nThe Julia language and community have been crucial in allowing programming abstractions. Parameterizing types with `AbstractFloat` optimizes the code to a user-specified floating point precision, and `AbstractDifferentiation.jl` allows us to easily support many AD engines, dependence-free.\r\n\r\nWe demonstrate our code with an example optimal control problem: optimizing the trajectory of a space-shuttle landing.",

We present theoretical work which justifies this extension. In particular, we extend the earlier concentration bounds to all JL sketching operators and examine this bound for specific classes of such operators including the original Gaussian sketching operators, subsampled randomized Hadamard transform (SRHT) and the sparse Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform (SJLT). We demonstrate experimentally that using SJLT instead of Gaussian sketching operators leads to 1.5 - 2.5X speedups of the HSS construction implementation in the STRUMPACK C++ library. The generalized algorithm allows users to select their own JL sketching operators with theoretical lower bounds on the size of the operators which may lead to faster runtime with similar HSS construction accuracy.",

However, this deconvolution problem gives a loss function that requires the optimization routine to be: \r\n- Global, since the loss is not convex and has many local minima\r\n- Compiled, since the loss is heavy and cannot be parallelized\r\n- In arbitrary precision, due to combinatorial reasons. \r\n\r\nIn both Python, R and C++, these three conditions were incompatible and forces us to re-code a full library. However, the ease of code reuse in the Julia ecosystem allowed us to solve our problem using existing libraries.",

  "description": "Graph alignment, also known as graph matching, is the problem of recovering a bijection between the vertex sets of two graphs, that minimizes edge disagreements. \r\n\r\nGiven the adjacency matrices A,B ∈ 𝐑ᴺˣᴺ  of the graphs G₁ and G₂ with vertex set {1, . . ., N} the problem can be formulated as follows:\r\n\r\nmin ||A−PBPᵀ||² \r\n\r\n  s.t. P ∈ 𝑷\r\n\r\nwhere  𝑷 is the set of N×N permutation matrices and ||·|| is the Frobenius norm.\r\nIn the case of two isomorphic graphs its solution is an isomorphism. The calculation of its solution is NP-hard.\r\n\r\nThe graph alignment problem can be encountered in various fields in which graphs have to be compared such as computer vision, social networks, molecular biology and neuroscience. In the latter, areas of connectomes (nodes of graphs representing neural connections in the brain) are analyzed. These kinds of graphs are often very large, so efficient graph alignment algorithms are essential for many applications. One of the most popular algorithms that solves the problem is the Fast Approximate Quadratic (FAQ) algorithm [1,2]. It is designed to solve a relaxed version of the above formulation, in which the convex-hull of the permutation matrices, i.e. doubly stochastic matrices, is considered as a feasible region. In this way, the Frank–Wolfe algorithm can be applied to find a doubly stochastic matrix, which is subsequently projected by solving a linear assignment problem, onto the set of permutation matrices, finding an approximate solution.The linear assignment problem is also used at each iteration of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and is the bottleneck of the procedure. For this reason, it has been replaced in the recent GOAT algorithm [3] with the optimal transport problem solved via the Sinkhorn algorithm. In this talk, we will first briefly introduce the GraphsOptim.jl package [4] and then focus on the details and Julia implementation of the FAQ and GOAT algorithms.\r\n\r\n [1] J. T.

He has used it daily since 2013 to perform many activities related to his work. As his most significant project with this language, he developed a complete AOCS simulator to test and verify this subsystem. The simulation achieved outstanding performance and accuracy, given the orbital data collected from the satellite Amazonia-1.\r\n\r\nHe is the creator and maintainer of some important packages of the Julia language ecosystem: ReferenceFrameRotations.jl, SatelliteToolbox.jl, PrettyTables.jl, and others."

  "description": "The satellite attitude is defined as its orientation in space. Most satellites require attitude control to point their payloads to acquire the data. The satellite subsystem in charge of estimating and controlling the attitude is the attitude determination and control subsystem (ADCS). When this subsystem can also maintain the satellite orbit, it is called the attitude and orbit control subsystem (AOCS).\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to reliably reproduce the space rigid-body dynamics on the ground. Hence, the development of the AOCS highly depends on simulation from the design phase up to the acceptance tests. This specificity leads to an \"n-simulator\" problem, where each development phase requires constructing some simulation tool. For example, when developing and tuning the control loop, the specialist must use a minimal dynamics simulation to verify the control law. In a more advanced phase, when the embedded software is being coded, the software engineer should also use a simulator to perform closed-loop tests to check whether the control laws are correctly implemented.\r\n\r\nGiven all the difficulties that arise from keeping all those simulators, the AOCS development usually happens through unit tests and simple scenarios. However, unit tests can hardly verify the entire AOCS algorithms, for it depends on Markov chains. Thus, more than a simple input/output verification is needed, and a vast number of internal states must be taken into account. Deeper tests only occur with the onboard computer in a hardware-in-the-loop simulation when everything is implemented. Even though this approach usually simplifies the simulation requirements, some errors can only be spotted late, leading to significant problems for the project. One of them is the time required for algorithm testing and debugging using real hardware. Those are expensive tests since they happen in real-time, leading to a significant mobilization of the test team and the use of expensive flight hardware.\r\n\r\nPreviously, using the packages SatelliteToolbox.jl, ReferenceFrameRotations.jl, and DifferentialEquations.jl, we managed to create high fidelity simulator for the Brazilian Multi-Mission Platform (PMM, in Portuguese), called PmmAocsSimulator.jl. We validated this tool using on-orbit data from the Amazonia-1 satellite.\r\n\r\nFor our next AOCS generation, we want to rely on the validated simulator code for all the development phases. The algorithms for the embedded software are initially constructed in Julia inside the PmmAocsSimulator.jl. When the control engineer validates the dynamics, the Julia code is translated to C++ using the CxxWrap.jl package, which is also run inside the same environment. Afterward, the same C++ code is compiled for the onboard processor and run in its emulator. In this phase, the onboard software is also tested in a closed-loop environment using the PmmAocsSimulator.jl. Lastly, the AOCS software is integrated with the rest of the satellite computer software, and a final simulation takes place using the real onboard computer.\r\n\r\nSince all the phases are simulated using the same validated environment, the results must be perfectly matched. This workflow allows us to develop the next AOCS generation with a huge gain compared to the classic scenario. The development can happen incrementally but also with a full test suite encompassing the most significant dynamics states of the satellite, which is impossible to reproduce without such an environment. Hence, most of the issues related to attitude control can be spotted and solved by the AOCS team before the final software integration. All this workflow is only possible given the considerable adaptability of the Julia language and the tools available in its ecosystem.\r\n\r\nFinally, the gains obtained by this new workflow are massive. We have already implemented 50% of the AOCS functions for the next-generation software, and we have yet to identify a single algorithm bug at the final test stage with the flight hardware. This process allowed us to drastically reduce the test hours using the real satellite computer, which also helped diminish the development cost.\r\n\r\nThis talk will detail all the processes mentioned before, stating how the Julia language and its ecosystem are being used at the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) to solve the n-simulator problem by providing one single simulator for all the AOCS development phases.",

  "description": "The lumped-parameter model (also called lumped-element model) simplifies the description of the behavior of spatially distributed physical systems, such as electrical circuits, into a topology consisting of discrete entities that approximate the behavior of the distributed system under certain assumptions. It is useful in electrical systems (including electronics), mechanical multi-body systems, heat transfer, acoustics and circulatory mechanics.\r\n\r\nOur focus in this workshop will will be on the dynamics of the circulatory system, or cardio-vascular system. Within the realm of circulatory system mechanics, lumped parameter (0D) modelling offers the unique ability to examine both cardiac function and global hemodynamics within the context of a single model. Due to the interconnected nature of the cardiovascular system, being able to quantify both is crucial for the effective prediction and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Lumped parameter modelling derives one of its main strengths from the minimal computation time required to solve ODEs and algebraic equations. Furthermore, the relatively simple structure of the model allows most personalized simulations to be automated. Meaning the ability to embed these lumped parameter models into a clinical workflow could one day become trivial.\r\n\r\nCirculatorySystemModels.jl is an acausal modelling library, built on top of ModelingToolkit.jl and the SciML ecosystem. This tight integration means that once the model is set up, global optimization, sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis, ..., are just a few lines of code away. And due to the speed of Julia, even high-dimensional parameter models become feasible for a high-abstraction level modeling system.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop we will introduce CirculatorySystemModels.jl in a hands on fashion. We will walk users through the fundamentals of acausal modelling, and will then demonstrate how we can build up complex cardio-vascular network from simple elements in a \"if you can draw it, you can model it paradigm\" by simply connecting the individual components. We will then use the power of ModelingToolkit.jl, DifferentialEquations.jl, and other packagers in the SciML ecosystem to show how the created models can be fed into the wider analysis framework.\r\n\r\nWe will demonstrate how new models/elements can be implemented. We will then take the user through the event handling feature within ModelingToolkit to demonstrate how we can recreate complex physiological components which open a new era of modelling which other platforms can't support. In the second half of the workshop we will focus on model analysis and demonstrate how our pre-built circulation models can be used within relevant research. The participants will leave with a clear understanding of how to use the Julia package ecosystem to efficiently handle these difficult circulation models, and will have a new perspective for understanding the model analysis advances made by Julia in recent years.",

  "description": "We introduce Ignite.jl (https://github.com/jondeuce/Ignite.jl), a package for simplifying neural network training and validation loops in Julia. Based on the popular Python library ignite, Ignite.jl provides a high-level, flexible event-based approach for training and evaluating neural networks in Julia with flexibility.\r\n\r\nThe traditional way of training a neural network typically involves using for/while loops and callback functions. However, this approach can become complex and difficult to maintain as the number of events increases and the training pipeline becomes more intricate. Ignite.jl addresses this issue by providing a simple yet flexible engine and event system that allows for the easy composition of training pipelines with various events such as artifact saving, metric logging, and model validation.\r\n\r\nEvent-based training abstracts away the traditional training loop, replacing it with:\r\n1. a training engine which executes a single training step,\r\n2. a data loader iterator which provides data batches, and\r\n3. events and corresponding handlers which are attached to the engine and are configured to fire at specific points during training.\r\n\r\nEvent handlers are much more flexible compared to other approaches like callbacks: they can be any callable, multiple handlers can be attached to a single event, multiple events can trigger the same handler, and custom events can be defined to fire at user-specified points during training. This makes adding functionality to your training pipeline easy, minimizing the need to modify existing code.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the benefits of using Ignite.jl, we provide a minimal working example in the README.md file that demonstrates how to train a simple neural network while periodically logging evaluation metrics. In particular, we highlight that periodic model and optimizer saving can be added with no changes to the rest of the training pipeline – simply add another event. This example illustrates the benefits of separating the training step from the training loop, and how to simple it is to customize the training pipeline.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Ignite.jl is a simple and flexible package that improves the process of training neural networks by using events and handlers. It allows for easy modifications to training pipelines without needing to change existing code, it is well-documented, and thoroughly tested. We believe Ignite.jl will be a valuable addition to the Julia machine learning ecosystem.",

It enables high-accuracy orbit determination for near-Earth asteroids and comets from optical and radar astrometry. NEOs.jl features exploitation of high-order automatic differentiation techniques, known as jet transport, in order to quantify orbital uncertainties in a versatile, semi-analytical manner. The optical astrometry error model incorporates state-of-the-art dynamical and observational models, and accounts for biases present in star catalogs, as well as other sources of systematic errors via an appropriate weighting scheme; this considerations are important when dealing with high-precision orbit determinaiton. As part of the development of NEOs.jl, we also implemented a Julia package with our own planetary ephemeris integrator, PlanetaryEphemeris.jl, based on the DE430 planetary and lunar ephemeris dynamical model produced by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Using NEOs.jl we have estimated the Yarkovsky acceleration acting on asteroid Apophis and have ruled out potential impacts on 2036 and 2068.

  "description": "This talk will introduce Vahana.jl, a new open-source software framework tailored to the development of large-scale agent-based models (ABMs), with a focus on complex social networks.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of Vahana.jl lies in an approach to ABM known as a synchronous graph dynamical system (SyGDS). This method advances the principles of cellular automata by transitioning from cells to vertices of a graph representing agents, and using directed edges to establish neighborhood interactions.\r\n\r\nVahana.jl elevates the concept of SyGDS by introducing several by adding a multi-layer approach that enabling a more nuanced and detailed representation of complex systems by treating different interactions as distinct layers in the graph.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the theoretical discussion of SyGDS, the talk will of course also provide practical insights by implementing an (incomplete) toy model. Furthermore, we also demonstrate how spatial information can be embedded in the graph structure and how Vahana integrates with the Julia Ecosystem, such as DataFrames and Graphs.\r\n\r\nThe development of Vahana.jl has been driven by a strong focus on performance. The presentation discusses how this emphasis influenced the design and implementation choices, highlighting the effective use of Julia's meta-programming features to enhance the execution speed of simulations. This performance aspect is substantiated with results from two distinct models, including a simulation of Covid-19 spread across Germany, demonstrating Vahana's applicability to real-world scenarios and its capacity for large-scale simulations.\r\n\r\nLinks:\r\nRepository: https://github.com/s-fuerst/Vahana.jl\r\nDocumentation: https://s-fuerst.github.io/Vahana.jl/dev/\r\nEpisim example: https://git.zib.de/sfuerst/vahana-episim/",

  "description": "Vim is a ubiquitous text editor found on almost every modern operating system. Vim (and its predecessor vi) has a storied history as a primary contender in the “editor wars”, its modal editing paradigm often pinned against the modeless, extensibility-oriented Emacs.\r\n\r\nVim users often tout its speed and ease of use, at least after stomaching a steep learning curve. Once a user has learned vim they might question why their fingers should leave home-row, even when they aren’t using vim. Their muscle memory can be applied across many applications by using vim emulation plugins or packages: browsers (vimium and vim vixen), email clients (mutt), IDE plugins (vscode-neovim for vs-code, ideavim for IntelliJ), and shell modes (zsh, bash, fish). Vim emulation can even be used to interact with an operating system: sway for Linux users, AppGrid for MacOS users, or evil mode for Emacs users.\r\n\r\nFinally, users can use vim emulation in the Julia REPL. In this talk I will describe how VimBindings.jl works, as well as the design considerations borrowed from other vim emulation implementations in its development. I will take a deep dive into the Julia REPL code and describe how the package introduces new functionality to the REPL, I will also discuss the unique challenges faced during the creation of VimBindings.jl, and the not-so-elegant solutions developed to solve them.\r\n\r\nGithub repo: https://github.com/caleb-allen/VimBindings.jl",

  "description": "For the development of massively scalable high performance 3-D partial differential equation (PDE) solvers we rely on the usage of a powerful matrix-free pseudo-transient iterative algorithm. The algorithm allows for formulating the update rules for fields in a form close to the explicit time integration. This formulation is optimally suited for both shared and distributed memory parallelization.\r\n\r\nWith respect to implementation, our approach is instantiated in the packages ParallelStencil.jl and ImplicitGlobalGrid.jl. It is fully architecture-agnostic and, for GPU, it includes the automatic generation of on-chip memory usage-optimized computation kernels as well as the automatic determination of their launch parameters. On-chip memory usage-optimization is achieved by explicitly reading large arrays through the memory shared by the threads of a block - when beneficial and when hardware resources allow for it - and by steering register usage in order to keep data that is to be reused whenever possible on the chip. The optimizations are applicable to complex real world applications: a simplified, less on-chip memory requiring optimization strategy can be used for a part of the kernel input arrays when the most aggressive optimization strategy would lead to a resource exhaustion. Kernel launch parameters as blocks, threads and required shared memory can be automatically defined in agreement with the applied optimizations. Furthermore, communication can be automatically hidden behind computation, including with on-chip memory usage-optimization activated.\r\n\r\nWe compare the performance achieved for some representative computation kernels against the performance obtained using alternative ways to express equivalent computations in Julia, for example using GPU array broadcasting or straightforward CUDA.jl kernel programming. Finally, we report the scaling of some earth science applications on the European flagship supercomputer LUMI at CSC in Finland, hosting AMD GPUs, and on the Piz Daint supercomputer at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre in Switzerland, hosting NVIDIA GPUs.\r\n\r\nCo-authors: Ludovic Räss¹ ², Ivan Utkin¹\r\n\r\n¹ ETH Zurich | ² Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL)",

  "description": "[PackageAnalyzer.jl](https://github.com/JuliaEcosystem/PackageAnalyzer.jl) lets you statically inspect the content of a package and collect information about the use of documentation, testing suite, continuous integration, as well as the licenses used, the number of lines of code, the number of contributors. Additionally, using JuliaSyntax.jl, PackageAnalyzer can introspect the source code and count the number of struct definitions, exports, method definitions, and more. PackageAnalyzer also supports analyzing an entire `Manifest.toml` or even a whole registry, and takes care to look at exactly the code specified in a manifest rather than the latest version of the code in its source repository. This can be used to check that e.g. all dependencies in an application have an open-source license, or have tests, and is new to PackageAnalyzer v1.0.\r\n\r\nWe will show how to use PackageAnalyzer in an example application, and the kinds of analyses which can be performed. We will also show statistics about the whole open-source ecosystem, as an update to the JuliaCon 2021 talk called _Code, docs, and tests: what's in the General registry?_. We'll talk about the current state of the ecosystem as well as how it has grown and changed since 2021.",

  "description": "As we embrace the era of exascale computing, scalable performance and fast development on extremely heterogeneous hardware have become ever more important aspects for high-performance computing (HPC). Scientists and developers with interest in Julia for HPC need to know how to leverage the capabilities of the  language and ecosystem to address these issues and which tools and best practices can help them to achieve their performance goals.\r\n\r\nWhat do we mean by HPC? While HPC can be mainly associated with running large-scale physical simulations like computational fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics, high-energy physics, climate models etc., we use a more inclusive definition beyond the scope of computational science and engineering. More recently, rapid prototyping with high-productivity languages like Julia, machine learning training, data management, computer science research, research software engineering, large scale data visualization and in-situ analysis have expanded the scope for defining HPC. For us, the core of HPC is not to run simple test problems faster but involves everything that enables solving challenging problems in simulation or data science, on heterogeneous hardware platforms, from a high-end workstation to the world's largest supercomputers powered with different vendors CPUs and accelerators (e.g. GPUs).\r\n\r\nIn this three-hour minisymposium, we will give an overview of the current state of affairs of Julia for HPC in a series of ~10-minute talks. The focus of these overview talks is to introduce and motivate the audience by highlighting aspects making the Julia language beneficial for scientific HPC workflows such as scalable deployments, compute accelerator support, user support, and HPC applications. In addition, we have reserved some time for participants to interact, discuss and share the current landscape of their investments in Julia HPC, while encouraging networking with their colleagues over topics of common interest.\r\n\r\n### Minisymposium Schedule\r\n\r\n* 10:30: Carsten Bauer (PC2) & Samuel Omlin (CSCS): Welcome and Overview\r\n\r\n**Part I (Scaling Applications)**\r\n\r\n* 10:40: Ludovic Räss (ETHZ): Scalability and HPC readiness of Julia’s AMD GPU stack\r\n\r\n* 10:55: Dominik Kiese (Flatiron Institute): Large-scale vertex calculations in condensed matter physics with Julia\r\n\r\n* 11:10: Michael Schlottke-Lakemper (RWTH Aachen) & Hendrik Ranocha (U Hamburg): Scaling Trixi.jl to more than 10,000 cores using MPI\r\n\r\n* 11:25: Q&A\r\n\r\n* 11:30: Short break\r\n\r\n**Part II (Performance Evaluation & Tuning)**\r\n\r\n* 11:40: William F Godoy (ORNL): Julia programming models evaluation on Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facilities: Summit and Frontier\r\n\r\n* 11:55: Mosé Giordano (UCL): MPI, SVE, 16-bit: using Julia on the fastest supercomputer\r\n\r\n* 12:10: Carsten Bauer (PC2): HPC Tools for Julia: Inspecting, Monitoring, and Tuning Performance\r\n\r\n* 12:25: Q&A\r\n\r\n* 12:30: Time for lunch 😉\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Lunch break (1:30h)**\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Part III (Ecosystem Developments)**\r\n\r\n* 2:00: Tim Besard (Julia Computing): Update on oneAPI.jl developments\r\n\r\n* 2:15: Julian Samaroo (MIT): Dagger in HPC: GPUs, MPI, and Profiling at great speed\r\n\r\n* 2:30: Johannes Blaschke (NERSC): Improvements to Distributed.jl for HPC\r\n\r\n* 2:45: Q&A\r\n\r\n* 3:00: Fin.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the minisymposium is to identify and summarize current practices, limitations, and future developments as Julia experiences growth and positions itself in the larger HPC community due to its appeal in scientific computing. It also exemplifies the strength of the existing Julia HPC community that collaboratively prepared this event. We are an international, multi institutional, and multi disciplinary group interested in advancing Julia for HPC applications in our academic and national laboratory environments. We would like to welcome new people from multiple backgrounds sharing our interest and bring them together in this minisymposium.\r\n\r\nIn this spirit, the minisymposium will serve as a starting point for further Julia HPC activities at JuliaCon 2023. During the main conference, a Birds of Feather session will provide an opportunity to bring together the community for more discussions and to allow new HPC users to join the conversation. Furthermore, a number of talks will be dedicated to topics relevant for HPC developers and users alike.",

  "description": "\"Energy system models are at the core of today’s energy related research and have been for decades. However, global challenges, such as those related to climate and politics, have intensified the necessity for ever evolving models, as well as the requirements regarding features and explainability. As energy sectors continue to become increasingly interconnected across different regions, model complexity has surpassed the advancements in computational performance during the last decade. In response, a diverse range of approaches, including various aggregation techniques and specialized solve methods, have been applied to address the issue of complexity, with varying degrees of popularity.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, a novel energy system model has been developed, which enables the representation of arbitrary systems as part of an abstract commodity (energy) flow model, thereby lowering entry barriers for researchers with diverse backgrounds. This model leverages cutting-edge operations research approaches, which have not yet been widely adopted within the energy sector. Leveraging the JuMP modeling language/framework facilitates scaling the model to continental-scale systems and outperforming many existing models.\r\n\r\nAlthough the model is currently closed source, efforts are being made to address the remaining hurdles and release it as an open-source software in the near future. During the development phase, certain issues such as concerns surrounding garbage collection pressure during model creation or methods for exploring parametric models using JuMP have been raised and addressed through discussions with the community and the JuMP-team.\r\n\r\nThis talk will primarily address the following topics regarding the novel energy system model: (1) the unique features of its underlying model structure that distinguish it from conventional energy system models, (2) the advantages of using JuMP for solving various types of energy system models, (3) the automated conversion of optimization models formulated using JuMP into LaTex code to facilitate model validation and formulation extraction, and (4) internal details pertaining to the model architecture. Please note that these points may be subject to change, as the model is still in an early stage of development and may incorporate additional novel features.\"",

  "description": "Biochemical systems theory (BST), developed beginning in the 1960s by Savageau, Voit, and others, is a modeling framework based on ordinary differential equations (ODE) in which biochemical processes are represented using power-law expansions in the system's variables. In this talk, we introduce [BSTModelKit.jl](https://github.com/varnerlab/BSTModelKit.jl), a Julia package dedicated to the automatic generation and analysis of BST models of metabolic and signal transduction networks. [BSTModelKit.jl](https://github.com/varnerlab/BSTModelKit.jl) features a simple domain-specific language (DSL) that specifies the model reaction network, methods to estimate steady-state and dynamic solutions to BST models, and methods to conduct global sensitivity analysis of BST model parameters.\r\n\r\nWe construct and analyze BST models of the thrombin generation dynamics of synthetic patients before and during pregnancy to demonstrate the features of the [BSTModelKit.jl](https://github.com/varnerlab/BSTModelKit.jl) package. Women are at higher risk for a blood clot during pregnancy, childbirth, and up to 3 months after delivering a baby. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that pregnant women are up to 5 times more likely to experience a blood clot than women who are not pregnant. A synthetic population of pregnant women was developed from patient data to understand better this increased clotting risk. Measurements of 11 coagulation factors involved with the regulation of thrombin generation and measurements of the hormones Estradiol and Progesterone were collected longitudinally from N = 38 women at three visits: V1 non-pregnant, V2 first trimester, and V3 third trimester. A corresponding Thrombin Generation Assay (TGA) was conducted for each patient sample, and parameters describing the dynamics were extracted.\r\n\r\nA joint probability model (assumed to be a multivariate normal distribution) was constructed from this matched data by computing the mean vector and covariance arrays from the experimental measurements. The probability model was then used to generate synthetic patient populations (dimension 1k, 10k, and 100k patients) that could be used in subsequent Machine Learning (ML) studies. One such ML study gauged how representative the synthetic population was of the original data. Next, an ordinary differential equation BST model of coagulation dynamics in individual patients was developed from the synthetic population and used to predict the patient TGA parameters. Patient-specific BST model parameters were estimated and used to simulate TGA patient data; the synthetic-patient BST models were consistent with true-patient TGA measurements. Further, global sensitivity analysis of the BST models identified which model parameters controlled the different aspects of the TGA measurements. Finally, by clustering the synthetic and actual patient data, using a radial basis function distance metric, our synthetic population recapitulated the empirically measured differences between the non-pregnant and pregnant states. \r\n\r\nThe following grants supported this work: The Interaction of Basal Risk, Pharmacological Ovulation Induction, Pregnancy and Delivery on Hemostatic Balance NIH NHLBI R-33 HL 141787 (PI’s [Bernstein](https://www.uvmhealth.org/medcenter/provider/ira-m-bernstein-md), [Orfeo](https://www.med.uvm.edu/biochemistry/lab_orfeo_research)) and the Pregnancy Phenotype and Predisposition to Preeclampsia NIH NHLBI R01 HL 71944 (PI [Bernstein](https://www.uvmhealth.org/medcenter/provider/ira-m-bernstein-md)).",

  "description": "In this talk, we will delve into the limitations of the traditional k-means algorithm, which often struggles to fit data that deviates from spherical distributions. In comparison, general Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) can fit richer structures but require estimating a quadratic number of parameters per cluster to represent the covariance matrices. Our research addresses these issues by proposing advanced global optimization algorithms that effectively combine with regularization strategies, leading to superior performance in cluster recovery compared to classical GMMs or k-means algorithms. Through a wide range of experiments on synthetic, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. We made available two Julia packages, UnsupervisedClustering.jl and RegularizedCovarianceMatrices.jl, that implement the proposed techniques for easy use and further research.",

  "description": "In the early 1970s, Jay Forrester, a notable and pioneer researcher in several fields, designed the first system dynamics model intended to analyze the complex interactions between high-level subsystems of the world, in order to understand the evolution of a major variable in each subsystem (in particular, the population, the capital investment, the natural resources, the fraction of capital devoted to agriculture, and the pollution level variables). His model, called World2, was published in the 1971 book \"World Dynamics\" and subsequently evolved into the World3 model, described in the well-known 1972 book \"The Limits to Growth\" by Meadows et al. Since then, several similar models were developed, such as the quite popular DICE model from the Nobel Prize laureate William Nordhaus, and categorized as Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), which can be roughly divided into two general classes: policy optimization and policy evaluation models. DICE is a policy optimization model in which, intuitively, we look for a set of parameters (that is, a policy) which maximizes a specific objective variable (or function). On the other hand, the WorldX models (which recently evolved in the Earth4All model) can be considered as policy evaluation models, in which we decide a policy (that is, a set of parameter values) and analyze the behaviour of some major variables (or functions). Benefiting from Julia's ecosystem for scientific computing and referring to this classification, WorldDynamics.jl has been developed to support the construction of policy evaluation IAMs and has already been applied to the reproduction of several historical models.\r\n\r\nWorldDynamics.jl leverages the ModelingToolkit.jl ability to compose differential-algebraic systems of equations. Indeed, an IAM is usually structured into several different subsystems whose variable interactions are modelled by differential-algebraic equations. As such, the goal of the model is to understand the evolution of some major variables. WorldDynamics.jl emphasizes this modular structure of IAMs by facilitating the coding of the systems of equations corresponding to the different subsystems and their composition by automatically deriving the connections among them (that is, their shared variables). By doing so, WorldDynamics.jl allows a designer to focus on a specific subsystem without necessarily knowing how another person is developing a different subsystem (interestingly, this seems to be how the well-known World3 model was described and, most likely, developed). Moreover, this approach easily allows the substitution of one system of equations (representing one subsystem) with another system of equations (still representing the same subsystem), provided that it correctly interacts with the other subsystems (intuitively, respecting the required input/output variable interface).\r\n\r\nAs an open-source package, WorldDynamics.jl also tries to democratize access to distinct models as well as to promote transparency among them. Even if most of the current models are freely available for reproduction, they are usually implemented using proprietary software, which prevents us from verifying precisely their internal operation and, hence, how the models are simulated exactly. By using Julia and its notable packages, WorldDynamics.jl provides a flexible framework that allows the usage of several solvers and integration with different methods with a reduced effort. Its current features include the implementation of the entire Club of Rome series of models with the possibility of easily replicating all the plots of their major variables that appeared in the literature, and changing parameter values and systems of equations in order to evaluate different policies. In conclusion, WorldDynamics.jl allows model construction in a simplified way while enabling the application of modern scientific computing techniques over new and classical models.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we are going to present the WorldDynamics.jl package as a whole.\r\nWe start with the motivations behind its creation followed by a historical display of classic models. Then, we emphasize our main goals and the challenges encountered during the development process (including how we translated equations from the DYNAMO language), explain the modular approach for implementing IAMS, and describe all the currently implemented models. Finally, we conclude the talk by indicating future works and a roadmap for the next releases. The presentation is intended to give the audience a general explanation of WorldDynamics.jl goals and capabilities. Along with this talk, we are also submitting a workshop proposal to interactively demonstrate the functionalities of WorldDynamics.jl with several hands-on examples.",

  "description": "Writing type-stable code has largely been accepted as a standard good practice. When the compiler can fully infer the types which flow through a program, it can apply optimizations and specialize to emit fast code for the specific function signatures that get compiled.\r\nThe process of method specialization and type inference is expensive and a main source of the perceived latency when using Julia. While in most cases, this one-time cost is acceptable for the performance gains at runtime, there are specific contexts in which the cost of such analyses becomes prohibitive.\r\nIn this talk, we present situations which may benefit from preventing the compiler to reason too much about the code, considering the trade-off between compilation and execution time. Such situations include evaluating generated code, especially generating new types. We also discuss other cases, in which certain data structures benefit from having non-concrete fields, such as `Expr` and other tree-shaped data structures.",

We hope this can serve as a good example of how to integrate high-performance 3D graphics and Machine Learning in a GPU-agnostic manner, and contribute to the expansion of the Julia ecosystem.",

  "description": "Quantum hardware, if successfully deployed in the future, would provide computational resources unavailable in classical computation. Nonetheless, we still need as-efficient-as-possible classical simulators for quantum dynamics: both in the experimental design process for quantum hardware and in the theoretical study of potential quantum algorithms.\r\n\r\nA vast array of techniques have been developed in the last 20 years: the direct non-scalable wavefunction simulators, capable of simulating a wide variety of analog noise processes; but also efficient special-purpose or approximate methods (e.g., Clifford circuit simulators applicable in error correction over thousands of qubits or tensor-network methods for approximate large scale dynamics).\r\nThus, a lot of questions arise for the scientist designing such machines: which simulation method would permit the study of the particular dynamic of interest, how most efficiently to model the environmental noise, and crucially, how to couple an efficient simulation of one type of quantum dynamics with a completely different methodology that has to be used for a different part of the hardware.\r\n\r\nOur answer to these issues is the **QuantumSavory.jl** family of packages. **QuantumSavory** provides for a formalism-agnostic way to describe the quantum hardware you want to study. Then it dispatches to the appropriate backend simulator: **QuantumClifford.jl** for Clifford circuits and error correction; **BPGates.jl** for even faster simulations of entanglement purification; **QuantumOptics.jl** for general purpose wavefunction simulations; and other special purpose-packages that can be easily plugged into the interface provided by QuantumSavory.\r\n\r\n**QuantumSymbolics.jl** is another crucial tool enabling the formalism-agnostic simulator: a symbolic quantum-focused CAS build on top of Symbolics.jl. In QuantumSymbolics one can operate on the \"Platonic\" representation of various quantum states and processes before converting them to a special-purpose numerical object to be used by the backend simulator (e.g. a density matrix for QuantumOptics or a tableau for QuantumClifford).\r\n\r\nOf course, these tools would not be complete without support for discrete event simulations (e.g. in quantum networks) and a rich library of plotting recipes for visualization and debugging, of which we provide a brief overview at the end.",

They consume 1.2 billion CPU hours annually and access our curated dataset from more than 100 countries worldwide.\r\n\r\nJulia Support at NCI \r\n\r\nOur user community has a very broad range of research interests, ranging from astronomy to bioinformatics, material science to particle physics, and climate simulations to geostorage. To accommodate this diverse demand, NCI maintains a wide selection of software applications, with the number of accumulated software versions exceeding 1000 just three years after the initial launch. \r\n\r\nWe started supporting Julia at NCI in 2018 on Raijin, which was the predecessor to Gadi. Now, more singularity modules containing Julia are available for users. These modules ship with over 500 popular packages to help users to quickly start their computations and try different workflows on many cores/nodes without worrying about the installation. \r\n\r\nUsers can run their Julia code in Jupyter notebooks using the prepared module through the Australian Research Environment (ARE). The ARE environment provides an interface to all types of compute architectures available on our HPC system, Gadi. For example, users can run their Julia code on GPUs with CUDA support across multiple nodes using either native SSHManager or MPIManager, while monitoring the GPU performance. \r\n\r\nWe are going to show three examples in this talk. First, Oceananigans ShallowWaterModel using two GPUs in a JupyterLab instance while monitoring the GPU usage. Second, the training of game connect-four using AlphaZero.jl across two GPU nodes and profiling the code using NVIDIA Nsight systems. Third, AEM inversion using HiQGA.jl on 7104 CPU cores and profiling the code using PPerf.jl and Intel-VTune.",

  "description": "This talk covers using Julia in data, insights, and decision intelligence teams. As a leader in a small data organization, you have to be careful about adopting new technologies, because you don't have any capacity to spare. That's why I'm here today to share my experiences with adopting Julia and give you a better understanding of its potential for your team.\r\n\r\nFirst, I'll cover the advantages of using Julia in your data team. You've heard that Julia is faster and easier for setting up your projects (and replicating your results in the future). But it's the Julia design philosophy and its ecosystem that makes it so productive to use. In addition, its tooling and community provide tons of learning opportunities, so you'll keep growing and improving just from your everyday work. Additionally, Julia has an unbeatable time to insight - not just the execution time, but end-to-end, from starting the project to sharing the insights with stakeholders, I'll demonstrate what I mean and why that is.\r\n\r\nOf course, no technology is perfect. I'll also be discussing some of the downsides to using Julia, such as internal challenges, the difficulty in finding talent with Julia skills and some red flags when you shouldn't adopt Julia (eg, large existing code, strict cross-dependencies, or deployment requirements.)\r\n\r\nBut the most compelling reason to consider Julia is its unreasonable effectiveness. I'll be sharing a few examples of how Julia has supercharged our small team and how you can benefit from it too (eg, workflow setup, re-use via small packages, documentation system, composability of tools, user-friendly APIs on custom types)\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while there are certainly some downsides to adopting Julia, the advantages and its unreasonable effectiveness make it a worthy consideration for data, insights and decision intelligence teams. I hope that by sharing my experiences and examples, I've been able to give you a better understanding of whether Julia is the right choice for your team and how you can effectively adopt it.",

  "description": "Quantum control seeks to design classical \"control fields\" in order to steer a quantum system in some desired way. It is a cornerstone of modern quantum technology: quantum control is how one generates entangled states for quantum sensing, or realizes the logic gates in a quantum computer. Solving the control problem requires numerically simulating the dynamics of the quantum system and then iteratively tuning the control fields to minimize some figure of merit. I will give an overview of the [`QuantumControl.jl` framework](https://github.com/JuliaQuantumControl), which implements state of the art methods for simulation and optimization.\r\n\r\nJulia provides unique advantages in flexibility and numerical efficiency, both of which are critical to quantum control. Multiple dispatch makes it easy to adapt to different physical systems and efficient representations. Furthermore, integration with the wider Julia ecosystem allows to leverage \"semi-automatic differentiation\" to efficiently optimize arbitrary, non-analytical figures of merit such as entanglement measures. Benchmarks show that Julia matches the performance of existing Fortran code for quantum control with ease. Using more specialized data structures, such as `SparseArrays`, `StaticArrays` or `GPUArrays`, depending on the use case, can further improve performance by a considerable margin.",

  "description": "Despite the great potential of NeuralODEs - the structural combination of an artifical neural network and an ODE solver - they are not yet a standard tool in modeling of physical systems. We believe, there are mainly two reasons for that: First, NeuralODEs develop their full potential if paired with existing models that capture some basic physics. However, existing models typically are set up in dedicated simulation tools and thus not available in Julia. Second, training of NeuralODEs is tricky and not yet plug and play. In this tutorial, we share methods to employ models from various simulation tools in NeuralODEs and training strategies that can deal with challenges of industrial scale. Both was validated in real examples ranging from automotive to medical use cases.\r\nFor us, one of the key challenges to make the jump from science to application, was to allow the re-use of existing simulation models from common modeling tools as parts of NeuralODEs. For this purpose, we picked the model exchange format FMI (https://fmi-standard.org/), which can be understood as a container format for ODEs and is supported by more than 170 simulation tools. Using our Julia package FMI.jl it is possible to handle FMUs – that’s how models compliant with FMI are called – in Julia. Further, the package connects FMUs to the common automatic differentiation packages in Julia. The library FMIFlux.jl enables the use of FMUs in machine learning applications. Using both allows for the following workflow:\r\n(1) Export your model from your favorite simulation tool as FMU, \r\n(2) Import the FMU in Julia, \r\n(3) Use the FMU as layer of an ANN in Julia, \r\n(4) Train the resulting NeuralODE, called NeuralFMU. \r\nUnfortunately, the fourth step is more complicated than it looks at first glance. NeuralFMUs or NeuralODEs in general tend to exhibit expensive gradient computation and thus very long training times. Further, they tend to converge to local minima or enter unstable regions. In order to cope with these challenges, we present strategies to\r\n•\tdesign a target-oriented topology for such a model\r\n•\tinitialize or even pre-train such models\r\n•\tdeal with large data and use batching\r\n•\tefficiently train such multi-domain models \r\n\r\nEquipped with knowledge about typical pitfalls and their workarounds, workshop participants will have an easier time dealing with their own NeuralODE applications.",

  "description": "Conducting health research studies at scale to understand the health of specific communities and subpopulations has long been a struggle. This has been due to a variety of issues, such as a lack of international standards in the structure of electronic health records, patient claims data, and diagnoses. Moreover, the investigation of questions related to the topic of health equity (that is, the skewed distribution of health resources or services to various subpopulations seeking healthcare) has been largely stalled due to these problems.\r\n\r\nIn a previous talk I gave, [Using Julia for Observational Health Research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XsWUZX6lFM), I presented early work on the success of using Julia within the space of observational health research in utilizing the [OMOP Common Data Model](https://jacobzelko.com/02082021170353-cdm-standardized-tables/). In that previous work, I conducted a pilot study to characterize prevalence rates in mental health care for [intersectional subpopulations](https://jacobzelko.com/11042022141714-what-intersectionality-theory/#workable_definitions_of_intersectionality) suffering from bipolar disorder, depression, and/or suicidality. This work utilized novel tooling and approaches created within Julia to successfully analyze data from ~2.5 million Medicaid subscribers within the U.S. state of Georgia. This work earned the [highest awards at the top observational health research venue](https://www.ohdsi.org/2022-collaborator-showcase), drove another successful grant proposal, and resulted in [multiple invited talks](https://www.nahdo.org/conference/2022/agenda). Buoyed by the interest and success of this pilot work, my team and I have moved this project into the next phase: the examination of more than 100 million patients from more than 4 countries across the globe.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will present advances within the JuliaHealth community and the broader Julia ecosystem that have made possible such large scale and federated analyses. In particular, novel JuliaHealth tools such as [OMOPCDMCohortCreator.jl](https://juliahealth.org/OMOPCDMCohortCreator.jl/) will be highlighted to show how to analyze \"big\" [real world data](https://jacobzelko.com/10282021140730-real-world-evidence/#united_states_food_and_drug_administration_definitions), how using Julia can be of huge benefit within this space, and how Julia community members could start using these tools for their own research. As this study now takes place across multiple countries, time will also be spent discussing how Julia lends itself very well to robust analyses using literate programming tools such as [Quarto](https://quarto.org) or [Weave.jl](https://github.com/JunoLab/Weave.jl) and versioning processes through [DrWatson.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DrWatson.jl) or [Data Version Control](https://github.com/iterative/dvc), which can be utilized to handle each country's specific needs. Additionally, I will spend some time discussing issues encountered (both technical and anthropological), ways that the Julia ecosystem could potentially grow to support future work in this research domain, and opportunities for Julia users to get involved. Finally, I will share my personal thoughts on what open questions there are to be addressed in observational health research and how Julia can be a tool to address public health questions and provide insight into questions of health disparities.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this talk will highlight the real world use of Julia in large-scale health research studies built on real world data. Moreover, it will show the potential of the various ecosystems within Julia to analyze and tackle complex questions within health equity. Through this talk, I invite future Julia users and researchers to join me in pursuing the potential of Julia within the space of observational health research.",

My research focus was mostly on theoretical neuroscience for a while,\r\nthen a research collaboration on deep connections between _partial metrics_ and _fuzzy equalities_, \r\nand finally (from approximately Fall of 2012) a research collaboration\r\non deep connections between _partial contradictions_ and _vector semantics of programming languages_ \r\nand, from 2014-2015 on, a series of research collaborations on _neuromophic computations with linear streams_. \r\n\r\nStarting from about 2011 I was gradually moving from just being a lover of computer animation and electronic music to\r\nmy first attempts to make some visual, audio, and audio-visual art of my own, and I am continuing to make new computer art every few months or so.\r\nIt involved playing a bit with MilkDrop 2 for WinAmp, mixing music a bit with Serato DJ,\r\ndoing a lot of animations and a bit of sound work in Processing, doing a tiny bit of that in Clojure,\r\nand finally working a bit with shader-based GLSL animations.\r\n\r\n### 2015-2021\r\n\r\n_Linear streams_ are streams for which linear combinations of several streams are defined. If one makes sure that\r\nlinear computations and general (often non-linear) computations are interleaved, then one gets continuously deformable programs which\r\nwe call **Dataflow matrix machines (DMMs)**. Another way to obtain DMMs is to start with recurrent neural networks\r\nand replace streams of numbers with linear streams and allow complicated \"activation functions\"\r\n(that is, transformations of linear streams) with arbitrary arity.\r\n\r\nThis setup also allows these neural machines to have very natural and flexible self-modification facilities.\r\nThere are toy implementations in Processing with mutable matrices, and the reference implementation in Clojure with\r\nimmutable streams of tree-shaped \"flexible-rank tensors\". The reference paper on DMMs is https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07447\r\n\r\nI hope to create the next application of this formalism in Julia \r\n(both **Julia Flux** and **JAX** are the machine learning frameworks which finally have sufficient flexibility\r\nwe need to take full advantage of the flexibility of DMMs). I started to switch to Julia in the early 2020.\r\nI recently sketched a three-page note outlining my hopes in this sense: https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~bukatin/towards-practical-dmms.pdf\r\n\r\n### 2022-present\r\n\r\nIn June 2022 I was able to perform the first successful experiments in DMM training and in program synthesis/circuit synthesis/DMM synthesis\r\nvia neural architecture search using Zygote.jl. The synthesized DMMs had pretty\r\nimpressive generalization properties. In September 2022 I was able to open source those experiments:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/anhinga/DMM-synthesis-lab-journal/blob/main/history.md\r\n\r\nThose experiments are the subject of the proposed talk.\r\n\r\nI am looking for collaborators. Creating an issue at one of my GitHub repositories is the easiest way to contact me."

  "description": "We are studying an interesting class of flexible neural machines where single neurons process streams of vectors with tree-shaped indices rather than streams of numbers (see https://anhinga.github.io/ and https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07447, \"Dataflow Matrix Machines and V-values: a Bridge between Programs and Neural Nets\"). These machines are expressive enough to be used for general-purpose stream-oriented programming (dataflow or functional reactive programs). They are also expressive enough to flexibly and compositionally modify their own weight-connectivity matrices on the fly. They can be thought of as flexible attention machines, with neuron inputs computing linear combinations of vectors with tree-shaped indices and thus working as attention devices.\r\n\r\nWe would like to explore a variety of machine learning experiments using this class of neural machines. In particular, it would be nice to be able to use differentiable programming and gradient methods in those experiments. Traditional machine learning frameworks would necessitate difficult engineering work reshaping those flexible tree-shaped vectors into flat tensors. \r\n\r\nZygote.jl provides flexible differentiable programming facilities and, in particular, allows users to take gradients with respect to variables aggregated inside a tree. That makes it a perfect fit for our machine learning experiments with flexible neural machines.\r\n\r\nWe consider the following novel algorithm for neural architecture search. Consider neural architectures where connections between neural modules are gated with scalar multipliers. Start with a sufficiently large network and perform sparsifying training of this network on a set of test problems using sparsifying regularization and gradually pruning inter-module connections with low gating weights.\r\n\r\nIn our case, the neural modules are powerful \"super-neurons\" of dataflow matrix machines. In our exploratory set of experiments we consider a duplicate character detector problem (a hand-crafted compact neural machine solving this problem is described in Section 3 of https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09470, \"Programming Patterns in Dataflow Matrix Machines and Generalized Recurrent Neural Nets\").\r\n\r\nThe history of our preliminary experiments is documented at https://github.com/anhinga/DMM-synthesis-lab-journal/blob/main/history.md\r\n\r\nThese are moderate scale experiments successfully performed on a home laptop CPU.\r\n\r\nZygote.jl is quite awesome, but using it is still not without some difficulties. In particular, while \"backpropagation theorem\" promises us reverse-mode gradients at cost of the corresponding forward computation multiplied by a small constant, in practice we often observe larger slowdowns (presumably this happens when the forward computation is friendly to compiler optimizations, while the induced gradient computation is not). When this slowdown is still moderate one can successfully use Zygote.jl. When the slowdown starts to exceed two-three orders of magnitude, it makes sense to switch to the stochastic approximation of gradient computations via OpenAI flavor of evolution strategies even if one is computing sequentially and not on a cluster (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06564, \"On the Relationship Between the OpenAI Evolution Strategy and Stochastic Gradient Descent\" by Xingwen Zhang, Jeff Clune, and Kenneth O. Stanley).\r\n\r\nIn our case, we have initially bumped into heavy slowdowns and memory swaps when trying to perform this neural synthesis in the most ambitious prior-free manner starting with a fully-connected recurrent machine with long backpropagation through time. \r\n\r\nBecause we have been aiming to synthesize feedforward circuits with local recurrences, we decided to scale our ambition down and rely on some priors and start with fully connected feedforward machines with skip connections and local recurrences.\r\n\r\nThen we have obtained acceptable performance and have been able to synthesize very compact, human-readable neural machines with rather remarkable generalization properties using a tiny training set.\r\n\r\nThese are very exciting preliminary results where nice-looking compact, human-readable neural circuits approximating a hand-written neural program have been automatically synthesized for the first time.\r\n\r\nWe hope that this line of exploration will be continued, by ourselves and by other people.

SymbolicRegression.jl was developed to democratize and popularize symbolic regression for the sciences, and is built on a high-performance distributed backend, a flexible search algorithm, and interfaces with several deep learning packages. The hand-rolled internal search algorithm is a mixed evolutionary algorithm, which consists of a unique evolve-simplify-optimize loop, designed for optimization of unknown real-valued constants in newly-discovered empirical expressions. The backend is highly optimized, capable of fusing user-defined operators into SIMD kernels at runtime with LoopVectorization.jl, performing automatic differentiation with Zygote.jl, and distributing populations of expressions to thousands of cores across a cluster using ClusterManagers.jl. In describing this software, I will also share a new benchmark, “EmpiricalBench,” to quantify the applicability of symbolic regression algorithms in science. This benchmark measures recovery of historical empirical equations from original and synthetic datasets.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will describe the nuts and bolts of the search algorithm, its efficient evaluation scheme, DynamicExpressions.jl, and how SymbolicRegression.jl may be used in scientific workflows.

  "description": "One of the most important problems in numerical analysis is the design of algorithms for solving the eigenvalue problem, i.e., to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. For a Hermitian matrix, this amounts to constructing a unitary transformation that brings it into a diagonal form. Traditional iterative algorithms, such as the Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm or the QR algorithm, accomplish this in a series of discrete steps. In the continuum limit, the unitary transformation is instead performed in a continuous fashion, as described by isospectral flows. Solving the ODEs modeling such an isospectral flow numerically in turn corresponds to an iterative eigenvalue algorithm. The QR algorithm, for example, emerges when sampling a particular isospectral flow at unit intervals [1].\r\n\r\nEigenvalue algorithms based on continuous isospectral flows have proven particularly useful for studying closed quantum many-body systems whose properties are determined by their Hamiltonian - a Hermitian matrix whose dimension grows exponentially with the number of system constituents. In this case, the operator structure of typical physical Hamiltonians can be exploited to introduce approximations that enable the analysis of larger systems [2].\r\n\r\nFormulating eigenvalue algorithms based on continuous isospectral flows in a differentiable manner allows for the efficient and accurate computation of derivatives of physical quantities of interest, such as (time-dependent) expectation values of observables, with respect to Hamiltonian parameters. The derivative information can be utilized to perform, e.g., parameter estimation, inverse Hamiltonian design, or sensitivity analysis. For the forward simulation of the ODEs, we utilize OrdinaryDiffEq.jl and custom implementations of solvers respecting the isospectrality of the flow. To compute derivatives we utilize the automatic differentiation (AD) framework of Julia, particularly SciMLSensitivity.jl, and define custom rules for forward- and reverse-mode AD tailored toward quantum many-body problems.\r\n\r\n[1] U.

  "description": "Radio astronomy is a rich and growing field with success that is closely tied to high-performance computing (HPC). In particular, the technique of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) – which recently culminated in the first images of a black hole – typically requires HPC at every level of its analysis. Indeed, even the \"telescope\" itself is created using HPC systems, with surface corrections and pointing performed digitally after the observations digitize and record the raw data. In the coming decades, new VLBI arrays such as the next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA), Square Kilometer Array (SKA), and next-generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) will come online. These new telescopes will drastically increase the recorded data volumes, necessitating new data analysis paradigms. For instance, the ngEHT will observe over an order of magnitude more often than the EHT, with twice as many dishes providing petabytes of data. New computational software must be developed to process and calibrate this enormous volume of data.\r\n\r\nThe process of forming an image in radio interferometry is also computational since the telescope doesn't directly produce an image. Instead, specialized computational algorithms analyze the data and produce images consistent with the recorded data. Furthermore, traditional imaging methods, while efficient, tend to produce suboptimal images compared to newer methods that directly fit the data products recorded by the telescope. However, these tools have traditionally been underdeveloped since they require highly performant computing. In addition, conventional interferometric imaging is an interactive process, with some algorithms requiring constant input from a user. Thanks to its dynamic and performant nature, Julia is primed to become the new standard in radio astronomical imaging. Julia has already started to be adopted within the radio community through analysis of data from the Event Horizon Telescope, where Julia aided in the construction of the first-ever picture of the black hole at the center of our galaxy. Additionally, JuliaAstro already has interfaces to several commonly used software suites within radio astronomy. \r\n\r\nThis mini-symposium's focus will be on the progress and development of Julia-based software within the radio astronomy community. This mini-symposium will be split into three parts:\r\n  - The first part will highlight where Julia has already been used within the radio astronomy community. Speakers will describe how they used Julia within their research programs. Additionally, the speakers will discuss their experience using Julia.\r\n  - The second part will highlight future directions of radio astronomy and the role of Julia. Speakers will describe what computational obstacles (e.g., data volume, processing speed, algorithmic development) radio astronomers face and how Julia could help.\r\n  - The third part will be a roundtable discussion of the presented topics and what areas of development and outreach the community should prioritize. Part of this section will be the start of a technical report highlighting the future development goals of the Julia radio astronomy field that will be published shortly after the symposium.",

  "description": "As we all know, the entire world of computation is mostly matrix multiplies. Within this universe we do allow some variation. Specifically, all the world is mostly either dense matrix multiplies or sparse matrix multiplies. Sparse matrices are often used as a trick to solve larger problems by only storing non-zero values. As a result, there is large toolkit of powerful sparse matrix software. The availability of sparse matrix tools inspires representing a wide range of problems as sparse matrices. Notably graphs have many wonderful sparse matrix properties and many graph algorithms can be written as matrix multiplies using a variety of semirings. This inspires developing new sparse matrix software that encompasses a wide range of semiring operations. In the context of graphs, where vertex labels are diverse, it is natural to relax strict dimension constraints and make hyper-sparse matrices a full-fledged member of the sparse matrix software world. The wide availability of hyper-sparse matrices allows addressing a wide range of problems and completely new approaches to parallel computing.",

  "description": "In my current research, I focus on the evaluation of non-Abelian topological invariants in periodically driven non-equilibrium quantum systems. These invariants offer a rich phenomenology and can give rise to new and unexpected dynamic behavior in current-day experiments. They are related to the properties of quasi-energy manifolds that form knots in space and time. However, their calculation can be very challenging and computationally demanding.\r\n\r\nTo address these challenges, I have been utilizing the Julia ecosystem, which offers a powerful toolset for numerical calculations. Julia's ability to easily integrate mathematical libraries and perform multiple dispatch has enabled me to streamline the calculation of these topological invariants.\r\n\r\nOne of the key features of non-Abelian topological invariants is that they are not captured by traditional static and field-theoretic approaches. In this work, I will focus on a specific class of non-Abelian topological invariants known as the Euler invariants. These invariants are related to the topological properties of real gauge fields and have been shown to play an important role in the behavior of certain materials. By evaluating these invariants numerically, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of their properties and their potential applications in the field of quantum physics. In particular, I will demonstrate how the degeneracies of the quasi-energy bands give rise to a implicitly defined manifold with multiple components that form a complicated knots. To evaluate the topological invariants, one has to calculate integrals of the wave function on the knotted structure of the manifold. By utilizing DifferentialEquations.jl, manifold.jl, and ForwardDiff.jl, I am able to parallelize these calculations and explore the space of topological phase transitions efficiently. I will present how these packages can effectively work together without going into details.\r\n\r\nIn summary, my research aims to utilize the Julia ecosystem to evaluate non-Abelian topological invariants numerically, with the goal of gaining a deeper understanding of the exotic material properties they give rise to. The results of this research have the potential to lead to new insights and applications in the field of quantum physics.",

  "description": "Radio astronomy is a rich and growing field with success that is closely tied to high-performance computing (HPC). In particular, the technique of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) – which recently culminated in the first images of a black hole – typically requires HPC at every level of its analysis. Indeed, even the \"telescope\" itself is created using HPC systems, with surface corrections and pointing performed digitally after the observations digitize and record the raw data. In the coming decades, new VLBI arrays such as the next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA), Square Kilometer Array (SKA), and next-generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) will come online. These new telescopes will drastically increase the recorded data volumes, necessitating new data analysis paradigms. For instance, the ngEHT will observe over an order of magnitude more often than the EHT, with twice as many dishes providing petabytes of data. New computational software must be developed to process and calibrate this enormous volume of data.\r\n\r\nThe process of forming an image in radio interferometry is also computational since the telescope doesn't directly produce an image. Instead, specialized computational algorithms analyze the data and produce images consistent with the recorded data. Furthermore, traditional imaging methods, while efficient, tend to produce suboptimal images compared to newer methods that directly fit the data products recorded by the telescope. However, these tools have traditionally been underdeveloped since they require highly performant computing. In addition, conventional interferometric imaging is an interactive process, with some algorithms requiring constant input from a user. Thanks to its dynamic and performant nature, Julia is primed to become the new standard in radio astronomical imaging. Julia has already started to be adopted within the radio community through analysis of data from the Event Horizon Telescope, where Julia aided in the construction of the first-ever picture of the black hole at the center of our galaxy.

  "description": "Simplifying the composition of machine learning (ML) interatomic potentials is key to finding combinations, between data, descriptors, and learning methods, that exceed the accuracy and performance of the state-of-the-art. The Julia programming language, and its burgeoning atomistic ecosystem, can facilitate the composition of neural networks and other ML models with cutting-edge interatomic potentials, through mechanisms such as multiple dispatch, differentiable programming, ML and GPU abstractions, as well as specialized scientific computing libraries. Here, the use of Julia to automatize the composition of a novel neural potential based on the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) is presented as part of the research activities of the Center for the Exascale Simulation of Materials in Extreme Environments (CESMIX). The proposed scheme aims to facilitate the execution of parallel fitting experiments that search for hyper-parameter values that significantly improve the accuracy in training and test metrics (e.g., MAE, MSE, RSQ, mean cos) of energies and forces with respect to different Density Functional Theory (DFT) data sets.\r\n\r\nMore information about composing ML potentials in Julia [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XI9zqF_nmSlHgDeFJqq2dxdVqiiWa4Z-WJKvj0TctEk/edit#slide=id.g169df3c161f_63_123).\r\n\r\nTake a look at our growing atomistic CESMIX suite in GitHub [here](https://github.com/cesmix-mit).",

I will start with a brief introduction on underactuated systems, and then explain how we can model system states (joint positions, velocities, torques, and contact forces). Next, I will go over the equations of motion that govern the system and show how to write equality and inequality constraints to enforce system dynamics, kinematic goals, and contact stability. After that, I will explain how we can formulate direct transcription problems in Julia (using existing packages from its rich ecosystem). In short, these are:\r\n\r\n- Ipopt.jl/KNITRO.jl for interfacing with off-the-shelf nonlinear programming solvers\r\n- RigidBodyDynamics.jl for calculating the whole-body system dynamics of complex mechanism models\r\n- SparsityDetection.jl, ForwardDiff.jl, and SparseDiffTools.jl for sparsity calculation and automatic differentiation of the NLP constraints and their Jacobians\r\n- StaticArrays.jl for non-allocating arrays used within the NLP constraints\r\n- MeshCat.jl for 3D visualisation of mechanisms\r\n- RobotOS.jl for ROS-related communications\r\n\r\nI will also mention TORA.jl, an open-source implementation of direct transcription for robot arms, and go over a Jupyter notebook with a demo.

  "description": "Julia SciML is a collection of hundreds of scientific computing packages for the Julia programming language. Historically, SciML began as a group of fast ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers. However, in the last half a decade, SciML has grown to include an extensive collection of packages geared toward modern scientific computing, with its own Computer Algebra System (CAS) and Domain Specific Language (DSL), the ability for heterogeneous computing (e.g., running code on GPUs), and seamless connection to machine learning packages.\r\n\r\nJulia SysBio community has significantly benefited from the SciML ecosystem. One of the first efforts to make SciML usable to the SysBio community was to provide importers and bridging packages (e.g., CellMLToolkit.jl, SBMLToolkit.jl) that allow for standard and well-curated models in open-source repositories (CellML, SBML) to be imported and used by the SciML packages. CellML models are generally in the form of ODE and are usually solved with the help of ODE and partial differential equation (PDE) solvers. On the other hand, SBML models are usually presented as reaction networks and are better suited to Catalyst.jl.\r\n\r\nWith the maturation of the SciML infrastructure and the availability of bridging packages between the biological models and the SciML ecosystem, it is time for applications! In this mini-symposium, we showcase some recent applications of SciML in SysBio in academia and industry.\r\n\r\nIn addition to presenting various applications, our plan is to have a forum to provide feedbacks from the community to the core SciML developers in order to guide the future development of SciML and related packages to make Julia and SciML the best environment for SysBio applications. \r\n\r\nPresenters:\r\n\r\n* Alex Cohen will be presenting on techniques for learning physically-constrained models in mode space to characterize the locomotion and behavioral states of animals that use undulatory locomotion. \r\n\r\n* Andrew Stine (United Therapeutics) will be presenting how Julia and SciML tools are used in QSP modeling teams at United Therapeutics.  \r\n\r\n* Torsten Schenkel/Harry Saxton will be presenting lumped parameter models We introduce CirculatorySystemModels.jl (CSM), an acausal model library built on ModelingToolkit.jl, containing a wide range of cardiovascular elements for creating complex models. CSM provides a common API, with automatic generation of ODEs meaning every 0D model can be solved with the same workflow, allowing for full integration with the SciML framework.\r\n\r\n* Katy Norman (Sanofi) will be presenting how Julia and SciML tools are used in QSP modeling teams at Sanofi. \r\n\r\n* Otto Ritter (Merck) will be presenting how Julia, Applied Category Theory, and SciML tools are used in QSP modeling teams at Merck with ReactiveDynamics.jl. \r\n\r\n* Sam Isaacson will be discussing high level progression of the systems biology ecosystem in Julia, providing important context on future steps and ways that the community can improve and collaborate.\r\n\r\n* Don Elbert will be presenting on variable volume models and his experience as a SciML user. This will provide important context on pain points for adoption and what we can do to make Julia the primary choice for modeling and simulation of biology.\r\n\r\n* Wiktor Phillips will be presenting his acausal neuronal modeling and simulation package, Conductor.jl.\r\n\r\n* Shahriar Iravanian will be presenting simulating cardiac electrophysiological ionic models as 2D/3D PDEs with the help of Julia and SciML and showcase the power of composition in Julia by using dual complex numbers in CUDA kernels to solve a biological problem (calculating the membrane impedance of cardiac cells).\r\n\r\n* Torkel Loman will be presenting Catalyst.jl and how chemical reaction networks are simulated in Julia.\r\n\r\n* Sebastian Micluța-Câmpeanu/Paul Lang/Elisabeth Roesch (JuliaHub) will explore strategies to handle parameter unidentifiability and integrate open standards and neural model autocomplete in QSP workflows.",

With more recent applications outside of this conventional setting, there has been an increased interest in the use of higher-dimensional tensor networks for the efficient representation and manipulation of high-dimensional data structures in general. [ITensorNetworks.jl](https://github.com/mtfishman/ITensorNetworks.jl) is an experimental package which aims to provide general tools for working with higher-dimensional tensor networks based on [ITensors.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl).

I will focus on the generalization of these algorithms to systems with arbitrary tree-like geometries and their implementation within the framework of ITensorNetworks.jl.

  "description": "Creating a feature-complete voice assistant for desktop computing is practically impossible, because it would mean to support any possible software that exists, including every tiny application written by individuals. Moreover, the way computers are used varies strongly from one user to the other, making personalizability indispensable for voice assistants. We address these challenges by empowering the users themselves to quickly assemble the voice assistant they desire.\r\n\r\n[JustSayIt.jl](https://github.com/omlins/JustSayIt.jl) enables to quickly assemble fully personalized voice assistants. One solely needs to define a normal Julia dictionary with command names as keys and objects representing actions as values. The object type determines the kind of action that will be taken at runtime. For example, if the object is a `Function`, then it will be called; if it is a `Tuple` of keyboard keys representing a keyboard shortcut, then the keys will be pressed; and if it is a `Cmd`, then the corresponding application will be opened. Furthermore, the object can also be an array of action objects, representing a sequence of commands. In addition, it is trivial to define application-specific commands, which is key to effective voice control: it is sufficient to create a dictionary with the application-specific commands and tie it to the `Cmd`-object triggering the application. [JustSayIt.jl](https://github.com/omlins/JustSayIt.jl) will then automatically take care of activating the application-specific commands when the application is opened, and deactivating them again as soon as another application is opened. The activation and deactivation of commands requires adaption with respect to the speech recognizers used and the transition between them is a challenge when required within a contiguously spoken word group; [JustSayIt.jl](https://github.com/omlins/JustSayIt.jl) solves this challenge by dynamically generating those recognizers in function of the word group context, when beneficial for recognition accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe action-semantics that is associated to the object types in the command dictionaries combined with the possibility to define command sequences on-the-fly and application-specific commands without effort results in an unprecedented, highly expressive and effective way to assemble personalized voice assistants. Naturally, it is trivial to share the command dictionaries defining the assembly of a voice assistant and the [JustSayItRecipes.jl](https://github.com/omlins/JustSayItRecipes.jl) repository provides a platform for it. As a result, [JustSayIt.jl](https://github.com/omlins/JustSayIt.jl) empowers the world-wide open source community to shape together each one's personal daily assistant.",

  "description": "While tremendous efforts are being made in every one of the above-mentioned fields by the Julia community, there are still some missing parts to bridge the gap between them and have a fully satisfactory solving process - meaning: an abstract description, as close as possible to the mathematical problem formulation, and an efficient & reliable numerical computation. The Julia language has a lot to offer in this respect, and there already are excellent codes available [1, 2, 3, 4], while mostly oriented towards « direct solving » (that is direct transcription of the original optimal control problem into a mathematical program). \r\n\r\nAs a group of researchers with a 20+ year history in the numerical solution of optimal control problems, we are very interested by what Julia offers out of the box as a high-level and efficient language. We have been involved in the development of several libraries in Fortran, C/C++, Matlab, python [5, 6] and the associated use of automatic differentiation (with Adifor, Tapenade, CppAD…) and are eager to share our experience and get feedback from the Julia community. Several examples of the numerical solution of optimal control problems can be found in [7] and include applications in biology, aerospace engineering, marine navigation, turnpike computation and hybrid problems. \r\n\r\nMore at [control-toolbox.org](https://control-toolbox.org), including tutorials on [OptimalControl.jl](https://control-toolbox.org/docs/optimalcontrol/stable)\r\n\r\n1.

  "description": "The need to be able to express constraints on data is common in various aspects of software engineering. A particular example that might come to mind is API design, especially inter-process API design, where it is useful to be able to make expose these constraints to consumers of the API. For instance, the [OpenAPI specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0) is a specification for REST APIs and is in turn an extension of the [JSON Schema specification](https://json-schema.org/specification.html). The OpenAPI specification leverages [the JSON Schema Validation specification](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation.html) to document constraints on data submitted to API endpoints.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Julia ecosystem has packages that handle the parsing of these types of schemas, such as [`JSONSchema.jl`](https://github.com/fredo-dedup/JSONSchema.jl) or [`OpenAPI.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/OpenAPI.jl), there is no such package making it easy to generate these types of schemas _from Julia code_. `ValueConstraints.jl` aims to fill that gap. It takes a declarative and introspectable approach to expressing constraints on values, so that other packages like [`StructTypes.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaData/StructTypes.jl) can be used to serialize the constraints into and from formats such as JSON Schema.",

  "description": "As we embrace the era of exascale computing, scalable performance and fast development on extremely heterogeneous hardware have become ever more important aspects for high-performance computing (HPC). Scientists and developers with interest in Julia for HPC need to know how to leverage the capabilities of the  language and ecosystem to address these issues and which tools and best practices can help them to achieve their performance goals.\r\n\r\nWhat do we mean by HPC? While HPC can be mainly associated with running large-scale physical simulations like computational fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics, high-energy physics, climate models etc., we use a more inclusive definition beyond the scope of computational science and engineering. More recently, rapid prototyping with high-productivity languages like Julia, machine learning training, data management, computer science research, research software engineering, large scale data visualization and in-situ analysis have expanded the scope for defining HPC. For us, the core of HPC is not to run simple test problems faster but involves everything that enables solving challenging problems in simulation or data science, on heterogeneous hardware platforms, from a high-end workstation to the world's largest supercomputers powered with different vendors CPUs and accelerators (e.g. GPUs).\r\n\r\nIn this three-hour minisymposium, we will give an overview of the current state of affairs of Julia for HPC in a series of ~10-minute talks. The focus of these overview talks is to introduce and motivate the audience by highlighting aspects making the Julia language beneficial for scientific HPC workflows such as scalable deployments, compute accelerator support, user support, and HPC applications. In addition, we have reserved some time for participants to interact, discuss and share the current landscape of their investments in Julia HPC, while encouraging networking with their colleagues over topics of common interest.\r\n\r\n### Minisymposium Schedule\r\n\r\n* 10:30: Carsten Bauer (PC2) & Samuel Omlin (CSCS): Welcome and Overview\r\n\r\n**Part I (Scaling Applications)**\r\n\r\n* 10:40: Ludovic Räss (ETHZ): Scalability and HPC readiness of Julia’s AMD GPU stack\r\n\r\n* 10:55: Dominik Kiese (Flatiron Institute): Large-scale vertex calculations in condensed matter physics with Julia\r\n\r\n* 11:10: Michael Schlottke-Lakemper (RWTH Aachen) & Hendrik Ranocha (U Hamburg): Scaling Trixi.jl to more than 10,000 cores using MPI\r\n\r\n* 11:25: Q&A\r\n\r\n* 11:30: Short break\r\n\r\n**Part II (Performance Evaluation & Tuning)**\r\n\r\n* 11:40: William F Godoy (ORNL): Julia programming models evaluation on Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facilities: Summit and Frontier\r\n\r\n* 11:55: Mosé Giordano (UCL): MPI, SVE, 16-bit: using Julia on the fastest supercomputer\r\n\r\n* 12:10: Carsten Bauer (PC2): HPC Tools for Julia: Inspecting, Monitoring, and Tuning Performance\r\n\r\n* 12:25: Q&A\r\n\r\n* 12:30: Time for lunch 😉\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Lunch break (1:30h)**\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Part III (Ecosystem Developments)**\r\n\r\n* 2:00: Tim Besard (Julia Computing): Update on oneAPI.jl developments\r\n\r\n* 2:15: Julian Samaroo (MIT): Dagger in HPC: GPUs, MPI, and Profiling at great speed\r\n\r\n* 2:30: Johannes Blaschke (NERSC): Improvements to Distributed.jl for HPC\r\n\r\n* 2:45: Q&A\r\n\r\n* 3:00: Fin.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the minisymposium is to identify and summarize current practices, limitations, and future developments as Julia experiences growth and positions itself in the larger HPC community due to its appeal in scientific computing. It also exemplifies the strength of the existing Julia HPC community that collaboratively prepared this event. We are an international, multi institutional, and multi disciplinary group interested in advancing Julia for HPC applications in our academic and national laboratory environments. We would like to welcome new people from multiple backgrounds sharing our interest and bring them together in this minisymposium.\r\n\r\nIn this spirit, the minisymposium will serve as a starting point for further Julia HPC activities at JuliaCon 2023. During the main conference, a Birds of Feather session will provide an opportunity to bring together the community for more discussions and to allow new HPC users to join the conversation. Furthermore, a number of talks will be dedicated to topics relevant for HPC developers and users alike.",

The capabilities in this layer are what pushed Modelica forward into applications like real-time hardware-in-the-loop because symbolic manipulation provides enormous benefits here that other tools, lacking symbolic manipulation, could not match.  There were some amazing contributions from Pantelides, Elmqvist, Otter, Cellier, and many others in this area and it is important that people understand these advances.\r\n\r\nFinally, you have the language itself.  While the symbolic manipulation opened many doors to extend what was possible with modeling and simulation, the language that was layered on top addressed very important ideas around usability.  It brought in many important ideas from software engineering to make modeling and simulation a scalable enterprise (allowing model developers to create models that had potentially 1000s of components and tens or even hundreds of thousands of equations).  But it also brought usability with a representation that quite naturally and seamlessly allowed graphical, schematic based modeling to be implemented consistently by a number of different tools.\r\n\r\nNone of this is to say that Modelica is perfect or that better tools aren't possible.  It is simply to raise awareness of all the things Modelica got right so that future generations can build on that and create even more amazing and capable tools to push the frontiers of modeling and simulation even further.",

  "description": "I am super happy to announce the release of IsDef.jl. Since years I wanted to be able to check whether some function is defined for my types. Plain `applicable` was not enough for me, because it just inspects the first layer, and if this is a generic function (like syntactic sugar), it won't give meaningful results. That was the motivation.\r\n\r\nIt turns out, you need full-fledged type-inference for this, however Julia's default type-inference is not intended for usage in packages. Inference is not guaranteed to be stable, may be indeterministic, and may change on any minor Julia version, which makes it really hard for maintainability. The purpose of Julia's default type-inference is just code-optimization and as such it is an implementation detail to Julia.\r\n\r\nHence, there is a need for another type inference system, or at least a layer around Julia's default inference which makes it maintainable. Welcome to `IsDef`.\r\n\r\nThe highlevel interface of IsDef is very simple, consisting of two functions `isdef` and `Out`. The usage of these will be explained, along with implementation details and design decisions. \r\n\r\nThe package version is 0.1.x - suggestions, critics, and improvement ideas about the way inference is made maintainable are very welcome so that IsDef.jl can become the go-to package for maintainable type inference.",

  "description": "The computational analysis of complex physicochemical phenomena or networked systems relies commonly on the simulation of detailed large-scale models. The computational burden imposed by simulating such large-scale models, however, is frequently found to render a range of scientific and engineering tasks like design, control or uncertainty quantification prohibitively expensive. To recover the tractability of such tasks in this setting, it is customary to build a compact, cheap-to-evaluate proxy for the original large-scale model which captures its dominant behaviors accurately, i.e, a reduced order model. And while there exists a wide range of systematic techniques to build such reduced order models, it typically remains a tedious, error-prone and often ad hoc process that frequently requires substantial intrusion into the original model. With ModelOrderReduction.jl we set out to streamline and largely automate this process, keeping active intrusion into the model by the user to a minimum. To that end, we rely on a symbolic representation of the original model specified via ModelingToolkit.jl. The reduction task is then performed on the symbolic representation using the tools provided by Symbolics.jl.  \r\n\r\nFor those who are non-technical, we will discuss how this approach fits into the paradigm of symbolic-numeric computing and as such  applies automatic code transformations beyond automatic differentiation that benefit greatly from the features of the Julia programming language.\r\n    \r\nFor modelers, we will show with scientific PDE and ODE models from the realms of chemical engineering and neuroscience how ModelOrderReduction.jl can help you reduce your models and speed up your computations.\r\n\r\nFor those who are technical, we will dive into greater mathematical detail about the model order reduction techniques that are supported in ModelOrderReduction.jl and why they lend themselves to being automated by way of symbolic computation. We will specifically focus on the automatic generation of efficient discrete empirical interpolators and polynomial chaos expansions as well as the associated reduced order models obtained from Petrov-Galerkin projection.",

  "description": "Roughly, the *lottery ticket hypothesis* says that only a small fraction of parameters in deep neural models are responsible for most of the model's performance. Further, if you were to initialize a network with just these parameters, that network would converge much more quickly than the fully parameterized model. We call the parameters of such subnetworks *winning lottery tickets*. A straightforward way to search for lottery tickets is to iteratively train, prune, and reinitialize a model until the performance begins to suffer.\r\n\r\nWe introduce `LotteryTickets.jl`, a forthcoming Julia library for pruning Flux models in order to find *winning lottery tickets*. `LotteryTickets.jl` provides wrappers for Flux layers so that one can define a normal Flux model and then prune it to recover the lottery tickets. All of the layers defined in Flux are supported, and it is made easy to define prunable wrappers for custom Flux layers.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a brief primer on model sparsification, this talk will discuss the main interface for `LotteryTickets.jl`, the key implementation choices, and an example of training and pruning a model end-to-end, even in the presence of custom Flux layers.",

Using graph theory, optimization problem components (e.g., variables, constraints, objective functions, or data) are stored within nodes and edges of a graph. This provides convenient visualization of the model, and it can lead to applications of various decomposition schemes to exploit the structure of the model. In this talk, I will present how we use Plasmo.jl and MadNLP.jl for building and solving graph-based optimization problems and how these packages can be used for exploiting some problem structures. \r\n\r\nWe use the package Plasmo.jl for building graph-based optimization problems [1]. This package extends JuMP.jl, and provides an interface for defining the optimization problem components within nodes and edges of a graph. Plasmo.jl uses an abstract modeling object called an OptiGraph which is composed of OptiNodes (similar to JuMP.jl’s Model object and which can store variables, constraints, objective functions, and data) and OptiEdges (which store constraints for variables on different OptiNodes and which capture connectivity of components). \r\n\r\nWe also use the package MadNLP.jl for solving graph-based optimization problems [2]. This package is a nonlinear interior-point solver similar to IPOPT. MadNLP.jl can interface with Plasmo.jl to solve problems defined within an OptiGraph, and it has the capability of exploiting OptiGraph structures using different decomposition schemes. Both Schwarz [2] and Schur [3] decompositions are enabled within MadNLP.jl, and these have been shown to reduce solution times.

  "description": "### 📈 The Need for Predictive Uncertainty Quantification\r\n\r\nA first crucial step towards building trustworthy AI systems is to be transparent about predictive uncertainty. Machine Learning model parameters are random variables and their values are estimated from noisy data. That inherent stochasticity feeds through to model predictions and should be addressed, at the very least in order to avoid overconfidence in models.\r\n\r\nBeyond that obvious concern, it turns out that quantifying model uncertainty actually opens up a myriad of possibilities to improve up- and down-stream tasks like active learning and model robustness. In Bayesian Active Learning, for example, uncertainty estimates are used to guide the search for new input samples, which can make ground-truthing tasks more efficient ([Houlsby et al., 2011](https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.5745)). With respect to model performance in downstream tasks, predictive uncertainty quantification can be used to improve model calibration and robustness ([Lakshminarayanan et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01474)).\r\n\r\n### 👉 Enter: Conformal Prediction\r\n\r\nConformal Prediction (CP) is a scalable frequentist approach to uncertainty quantification and coverage control ([Angelopoulus and Bates, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07511)). CP can be used to generate prediction intervals for regression models and prediction sets for classification models. There is also some recent work on conformal predictive distributions and probabilistic predictions. The following characteristics make CP particularly attractive to the ML community:\r\n\r\n- The underlying methods are easy to implement.\r\n- CP can be applied almost universally to any supervised ML model, which has allowed us to easily tab into the existing [`MLJ.jl`](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/) toolkit.\r\n- It comes with a frequentist marginal coverage guarantee that ensures that conformal prediction sets contain the true value with a user-chosen probability.\r\n- Only minimal distributional assumptions are needed.\r\n- Though frequentist in nature, CP can also be effectively combined with Bayesian Methods.\r\n\r\n### 😔 Problem: Limited Availability in Julia Ecosystem\r\n\r\nOpen-source development in the Julia AI space has been very active in recent years. [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/) is just one great example testifying to these community efforts. As we gradually build up an AI ecosystem, it is important to also pay attention to the risks and challenges facing AI today. With respect to Predictive Uncertainty Quantification, there is currently good support for Bayesian Methods and Ensembling. A fully-fledged implementation of Conformal Prediction in Julia has so far been lacking.\r\n\r\n### 🎉 Solution: `ConformalPrediction.jl`\r\n\r\nThrough this project we aim to close that gap and thereby contribute to broader community efforts towards trustworthy AI. Highlights of our new package include:\r\n\r\n- **Interface to [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/)**: turning your machine learning model into a conformal predictor is just one API call away: `conformal_model(model::MLJ.Supervised)`.\r\n- **Many SOTA approaches**: the number of implemented approaches to Conformal Regression and Classification is already large and growing.\r\n- **Detailed [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) Documentation**: tutorials and blog posts, hands-on guides, in-depth explanations and a detailed reference including docstrings that document the mathematical underpinnings of the different approaches.\r\n- **Active Community Engagement**: we have coordinated our efforts with the core dev team of [`MLJ.jl`](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/) and some of the leading researchers in the field. Thankfully we have also already received a lot of useful feedback and contributions from the community.\r\n\r\n### 🎯 Future Developments\r\n\r\nOur primary goal for this package is to become the go-to place for conformalizing supervised machine learning models in Julia. To this end we currently envision the following future developments:\r\n\r\n- Best of both worlds through **Conformalized Bayes**: combining the power of Bayesian methods with conformal coverage control.\r\n- Additional approaches to Conformal Regression (including time series) and Conformal Classification (including Venn-ABER) as well as support for Conformal Predictive Distributions.\r\n\r\nFor more information see the list of outstanding [issues](https://github.com/pat-alt/ConformalPrediction.jl/issues).\r\n\r\n### 🧐 Curious?\r\n\r\nTake a quick interactive tour to see what this package can do: [link](https://binder.plutojl.org/v0.19.12/open?url=https%253A%252F%252Fraw.githubusercontent.com%252Fpat-alt%252FConformalPrediction.jl%252Fmain%252Fdocs%252Fpluto%252Fintro.jl).

  "description": "Julia SciML is a collection of hundreds of scientific computing packages for the Julia programming language. Historically, SciML began as a group of fast ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers. However, in the last half a decade, SciML has grown to include an extensive collection of packages geared toward modern scientific computing, with its own Computer Algebra System (CAS) and Domain Specific Language (DSL), the ability for heterogeneous computing (e.g., running code on GPUs), and seamless connection to machine learning packages.\r\n\r\nJulia SysBio community has significantly benefited from the SciML ecosystem. One of the first efforts to make SciML usable to the SysBio community was to provide importers and bridging packages (e.g., CellMLToolkit.jl, SBMLToolkit.jl) that allow for standard and well-curated models in open-source repositories (CellML, SBML) to be imported and used by the SciML packages. CellML models are generally in the form of ODE and are usually solved with the help of ODE and partial differential equation (PDE) solvers. On the other hand, SBML models are usually presented as reaction networks and are better suited to Catalyst.jl.\r\n\r\nWith the maturation of the SciML infrastructure and the availability of bridging packages between the biological models and the SciML ecosystem, it is time for applications! In this mini-symposium, we showcase some recent applications of SciML in SysBio in academia and industry.\r\n\r\nIn addition to presenting various applications, our plan is to have a forum to provide feedbacks from the community to the core SciML developers in order to guide the future development of SciML and related packages to make Julia and SciML the best environment for SysBio applications. \r\n\r\nPresenters:\r\n\r\n* Alex Cohen will be presenting on techniques for learning physically-constrained models in mode space to characterize the locomotion and behavioral states of animals that use undulatory locomotion. \r\n\r\n* Shahriar Iravanian will be presenting simulating cardiac electrophysiological ionic models as 2D/3D PDEs with the help of Julia and SciML and showcase the power of composition in Julia by using dual complex numbers in CUDA kernels to solve a biological problem (calculating the membrane impedance of cardiac cells).\r\n\r\n* Torsten Schenkel/Harry Saxton will be presenting lumped parameter models We introduce CirculatorySystemModels.jl (CSM), an acausal model library built on ModelingToolkit.jl, containing a wide range of cardiovascular elements for creating complex models. CSM provides a common API, with automatic generation of ODEs meaning every 0D model can be solved with the same workflow, allowing for full integration with the SciML framework.\r\n\r\n* Katy Norman (Sanofi) will be presenting how Julia and SciML tools are used in QSP modeling teams at Sanofi. \r\n\r\n* Otto Ritter (Merck) will be presenting how Julia, Applied Category Theory, and SciML tools are used in QSP modeling teams at Merck with ReactiveDynamics.jl. \r\n\r\n* Sam Isaacson will be discussing high level progression of the systems biology ecosystem in Julia, providing important context on future steps and ways that the community can improve and collaborate.\r\n\r\n* Don Elbert will be presenting on variable volume models and his experience as a SciML user. This will provide important context on pain points for adoption and what we can do to make Julia the primary choice for modeling and simulation of biology.\r\n\r\n* Wiktor Phillips will be presenting his acausal neuronal modeling and simulation package, Conductor.jl.\r\n\r\n* Joe Bender (United Therapeutics) will be presenting how Julia and SciML tools are used in QSP modeling teams at United Therapeutics.  \r\n\r\n* Torkel Loman will be presenting Catalyst.jl and how chemical reaction networks are simulated in Julia.",

  "description": "## Introduction\r\n\r\nLogs, traces, and metrics are used independently to help diagnose systems for a long time. As applications are becoming more complex and more heterogeneous, pinpointing a problem is more difficult than before. Formed through a merger of the OpenTracing and OpenCensus projects, [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is aimed to improve the situation. In addition to [the concrete specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification), OpenTelemetry comes with a collection of APIs and SDKs in many different programming languages. As for now, Julia is not included yet. And that's why we created [OpenTelemetry.jl](https://github.com/oolong-dev/OpenTelemetry.jl). By fully respecting the OpenTelemetry specification, data collected in Julia with OpenTelemetry.jl can be analyzed together with those from other languages uniformly.\r\n\r\n## Highlights of OpenTelemetry.jl\r\n\r\n- **Simple API**\r\n\r\n  The APIs are elaborately designed by balancing conventions in Julia and specifications stated in OpenTelemetry.\r\n\r\n- **Fully Configurable**\r\n\r\n  Most components in `OpenTelemetrySDK` are configurable (either explicitly through keyword arguments or with environment variables). Users can decide how to collect the data, when to send the data, and where to store them. With the architecture of OpenTelemetry, users can choose any APM which supports the OpenTelemetry collector.\r\n\r\n- **Pluggable auto instrumentation**\r\n\r\n  Several commonly used packages in Julia are already auto-instrumented (Downloads.jl, Genie.jl, HTTP.jl, CUDA.jl, etc). Users can simply enable them by importing corresponding instrumentation packages.\r\n\r\n- **It's FAST**\r\n\r\n  The API layer and SDK layer are separated by design. The API layer is lightweight enough so that package developers can safely add it as a dependency with only very little overhead introduced. Our benchmark results show that the implementation in Julia is much faster than many SDKs in other languages.\r\n\r\n## Agenda\r\n\r\nThis talk contains the following three parts:\r\n\r\n1. A general introduction to OpenTelemetry and its benefits.\r\n2. An in-depth explanation of how OpenTelemetry.jl is implemented plus some personal experiences on how to implement and organize a mega Julia package  **in a more Julian way**.\r\n3. Demonstrations of how we apply OpenTelemetry.jl in realworld products.\r\n\r\n## Target Audience\r\n\r\nBoth package developers and application developers who would like to improve the observability of their services in production will benefit from this talk. General Julia users can also learn how to better collect, manage, and analyze telemetry data in a unified approach after this talk.",

  "description": "With its goal of having a single language for both prototyping research code as well as highly optimized, high-performance deployed code and this goal moving closer to completion year after year, one of the remaining challenges for julia is cross compilation to CPU architectures other than the running julia session. This talk will show some exploration in compiling julia code with a target of AVR and subsequently running that julia code, without a runtime, on an arduino. For this, two new support packages are used: [AVRDevices.jl](https://github.com/Seelengrab/AVRDevices.jl), for CPU specific definitions in the AVR family and [AVRCompiler.jl](https://github.com/Seelengrab/AVRCompiler.jl), for the cross compilation process. Afterwards, we'll look at some challenges for developing with such static compilation in mind, what could be done to make the experience smoother & easier to debug, as well as which features of julia are unavailable in such a restricted environment.",

  "description": "The efficient operation of a series of critical infrastructures such as water networks is essential to sustainable futures. However, to sustain good infrastructure services in many places, they need continuous expansion, mainly in response to population growth and rapid industrialization. As a specific example, consider a water supply network that supplies the required demand of different consumers using the available resources. However, for the smooth operation of the network, it is necessary to find new resources and connect them to the growing demand points in an economical manner. If this expansion planning is to be done for a long-term horizon, it requires considering uncertainties on various system parameters like demands, price of electricity, and availability of resources. These conditions also are similar to a great extent for the other infrastructure networks like electric power, gas, and district heating networks with their related equations, variables, and parameters. As a result, long-term infrastructure planning problems that confront high levels of uncertainty need an appropriate approach to modeling this process. For this purpose, multi-stage stochastic programming (MSSP) can be used as a well-established approach for dynamic decision-making under uncertainty. However, due to the nonlinear equation governing the operation of physical infrastructure networks, besides the mixed-integer nature of planning decision variables, this becomes a complicated non-convex problem. In this regard, an iterative procedure based on primal-dual decomposition and convex relaxation for solving this MSSP problem is put forward. This technique is motivated by explained planning problem that requires the satisfaction of constraints that describe operational processes for water supply infrastructure at multiple timescales. Since the aim is just finding a dual for the operation problem (pump scheduling or optimal power flow), each approach, like copositive programming, that can do this task can be used for this purpose. Here, applying a dual decomposition technique, e.g., optimality condition decomposition or Lagrangian relaxation, breaks the time dependency of intra-operation intervals. It also makes amenable the operation of the system in a decentralized mode by relaxing the coupling constraints like mass conservation and nodal power balance equations. If the operation problems are considered the subproblems (second-stage), their solving generates relative cuts for the master planning problem (first-stage problem). This procedure will terminate with the convergence of outer primal decomposition to an acceptable gap. Figure 2 represents the primal\\dual decomposition of the scenario tree Figure 1 in two steps. Flowchart 3 also shows the proposed solution technique graphically. The packages for solving the SP in the Julia programming language have been reviewed in Table 1. It is clear from this table that there is not any package to tackle the non-convex nonlinear mixed-integer MSSP problem. This work aims to develop a solver for this complicated MSSP problem. It also must be mentioned that although the proposed approach is applied to water supply networks, it is general enough to be used for any infrastructure network.",

  "description": "Geometric Algebra is a high-level mathematical framework which expresses a large range of geometric computations in a simple and intuitive language. From a single set of rules and axioms, this framework allows you to create diverse and geometrically meaningful spaces which best suit your needs.\r\n\r\nComplex numbers and quaternions may be identified as elements in such spaces which describe rotations in two and three dimensions. These spaces may express Euclidean transformations, such as reflections, rotations and translations; others express intersections of flat geometry such as lines and planes, and may include rounded geometry such as circles and spheres in slightly more complex spaces - all in a dimension-agnostic manner.\r\n\r\nThe price to pay for this unifying, high-level framework is extra mathematical structure that is generally not a zero-cost abstraction. However, by shifting the application of this structure to compile-time, it is possible to combine the expressive power of geometric algebra with highly performant code.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, pragmatic motivations for considering geometric algebra are provided, with a quick introduction to its formalism. Then, the open-source [SymbolicGA.jl](https://github.com/serenity4/SymbolicGA.jl) package is presented as a compile-time implementation of geometric algebra. It will be shown that the language of geometric algebra can be used to describe many geometric operations, all with a low symbolic complexity and in a performant manner.",

These include:\r\nIt should be easy to round-trip translate between Qurt and Qiskit, and to reproduce Qiskit\r\nfunctionality, including compiling circuits. The interfaces should be straightforward and\r\nemploy familiar concepts, similar to Qiskit or Circ. It should be easy to quickly define\r\nand use a custom gate. It should be designed with minimal barriers to achieving high\r\nperformance; for instance runtime dispatch must be avoided when handling circuit elements;\r\nData should be, to the extent possible, stored in vectors of bitstypes. Obviously some of\r\nthese goals are in conflict, so trade-offs will be adjusted as Qurt evolves. In fact,\r\nanother goal of Qurt is to explore data structures dictated by these trade-offs and use\r\nthis exploration to inform implementations in static languages where experimentation is\r\nexpensive.",

  "description": "SimJulia is an open source discrete event process simulation framework (Lauwens et al.). The framework transforms processes expressed as functions into resumable functions using the ResumableFunctions library (Lauwens et al.). Both SimJulia and ResumableFunctions are available through the general registry.\r\n\r\nThe current SimJulia implementation lacks functionality to transparently store state variables of such a process. The exploitation of the data generated by a SimJulia simulation depends entirely on the user's knowledge on technology for persistence and how to interact with it from within the simulation model. To mitigate this shortcoming, we extended both the SimJulia and the ResumableFunctions packages by implementing a transparent probing and data persistence architecture, employing Julia's metaprogramming support. Our implementation is based on the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) concept (Russell et al.) using the PostgresORM package (Laugier et al.), supported by the PostgreSQL Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), and Julia's macro expansion.\r\n\r\nA simulation model expressed using functions is transformed into resumable functions ready to be run by SimJulia. Our solution exploits the code analysis occurring during a first phase of running a simulation to store a monitored function’s state variables configuration in the database. This is achieved by using a static ORM configuration which maps an argument of such a function to a tuple in the configuration table.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the second phase, in which the simulation runs, macro expansion takes place, creating the object definitions based on the configuration saved earlier. During this macro expansion, the static ORM configuration is used to retrieve the tuples that define an object within the dynamic ORM. The dynamic ORM provides an object definition for each process within the simulation model, offering the possibility to describe the state of a process through a materialised object. This aspect aside, the dynamic mapping configuration between object and table is also provided through macro expansion.\r\n\r\nDuring the simulation, the standard working of the SimJulia package is to invoke an array of callback functions to be executed for successive events. The last function in such an array is the newly added probing function. When calling the latter, the process under consideration is matched against the object definitions created earlier through the dynamic ORM. An object describing the state of the process gets instantiated and is persisted again using the dynamically created ORM.\r\n\r\nConfiguration is kept in a versioned way in the database, enabling alteration of the simulation model while retaining the configuration of previous versions. The data and object definitions related to any version of the model are subsequently available in the RDMBS, and can be visualised using the technology of choice.\r\n\r\nThe current proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates the usage of the stored data and the versioned object definitions created dynamically during the simulations using the VueJS package. Through the intermediary of an abstraction layer which employs the dynamic ORM, we were able to provide VueJS with the required view on the data. We are currently considering the possibility to externalise the data based on a REST API for the presented architecture.\r\n\r\nOur contribution is twofold. For end users of the SimJulia package, we provide a transparent probing and persistence mechanism, removing the requirement to provide any configuration on this aspect. To the Julia community we demonstrate the usage of metaprogramming to divert from a static ORM configuration as often seen in web applications, to a transparent and dynamic configuration.",

  "description": "Neuroblox.jl is based on a library of modular computational building blocks (“blox”) in the form of systems of symbolic dynamic differential equations that can be combined to describe large-scale brain dynamics.  Once a model is built, it can be simulated efficiently and fit electrophysiological and neuroimaging data.  Moreover, the circuit behavior of multiple model variants can be investigated to aid in distinguishing between competing hypotheses.\r\nWe employ ModelingToolkit.jl to describe the dynamical behavior of blox as symbolic (stochastic/delay) differential equations.  Our libraries of modular blox consist of individual neurons (Hodgkin-Huxley, IF, QIF, LIF, etc.), neural mass models (Jansen-Rit, Wilson-Cowan, Lauter-Breakspear, Next Generation, microcanonical circuits etc.) and biomimetically-constrained control circuit elements.  A GUI designed to be intuitive to neuroscientists allows researchers to build models that automatically generate high-performance systems of numerical ordinary/stochastic differential equations from which one can run stimulations with parameters fit to experimental data.  Our benchmarks show that the increase in speed for simulation often exceeds a factor of 100 as compared to neural mass model implementation by the Virtual Brain (python) and similar packages in MATLAB.  For parameter fitting of brain circuit dynamical models, we use Turing.jl to perform probabilistic modeling, including Hamilton-Monte-Carlo sampling and Automated Differentiation Variational Inference.\r\n\r\nThis talk will demonstrate Neuroblox.jl by building small dynamic brain circuits.  We construct circuits by first defining the nodes (“blox”) and then either defining an adjacency matrix, building directed graphs, or sketching the circuit in our GUI to assemble the brain circuit ODE systems.  Using symbolic equations through ModelingToolkit.jl allows us to define additional parameters of the system that are varied across the system, which later can be used for parameter fitting of data.  We will also demonstrate the simulation of networks of several hundred spiking neurons representing a biomimetic reinforcement learning model.  We present visual patterns to these spiking neuron networks and apply a learning algorithm to adjust the weights to classify the different patterns.  The reinforcement learning feedback is implemented by frequent callbacks into the ODE system and allows us to monitor the learning rate continuously.  In addition, we will show examples of a larger brain circuit generating an emergent systems-level cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical loop, which selectively responds to learned visual patterns and matches many of the experimental data's dynamic behaviors from non-human primates.  Finally, we will show benchmarks comparing Neuroblox.jl to other implementations of brain circuit simulations. We hope to convince the audience that Julia is the ideal language for computational neuroscience applications.",

  "description": "With consistent need of efficiency, developers are required to write efficient and correct multithreaded code. Writing correct and efficient code is quite challenging. To better help the developers with multithreading, it is imperative to understand their interests and difficulties in terms of the multithreading code they are writing. The main aim of the study is to measure the challenges faced by developers in multithreading in Julia. This will help maintainers of Julia to improve its support for multithreading and help developers fine-tune their code to make it more optimized. More importantly, it would help developers to ask right questions on online discussion forums.  This study involves the analysis of Julia discourse and stack overflow posts, which were used to evaluate the type of questions on multithreading asked by Julia developers. This study uses qualitative content analysis which allows the categories to flow from the data. The research findings indicate that developers face a  lot of performance related issues, specifically the slow speed of their multithreaded code. This study also indicates that even though Julia provides official documentation about usage of macros and threads, developers tend to inquire about the minimal working example to learn about their proper implementation. It has also been found that programmers find it difficult to understand the pattern of memory allocation in their code which is one of the major causes of slow performance of multithreaded code. The study was expected to have queries related to testing and debugging of multithreaded code but surprisingly, there were negligible queries on that. This study also analyzes the different approach used by developers to ask their queries Julia Discourse and Stack Overflow.",

  "description": "Electronic structure theory describes the motion of electrons within a material, which has been critical for understanding the type of a material (e.g. insulator, conductor, semiconductor) as well as quantitatively predicting the properties of a material (e.g. thermal and electrical conductivity). The mathematics of the electronic structure theory is both conceptually difficult and computationally  \r\nintensive, making the development of readable packages challenging.\r\n\r\nWith `WTP.jl`, we simplify the development process by providing abstractions for commonly used concepts in electronic structure theory that are tricky to implement. Moreover, we design our interface to resemble the mathematical notation of electronic structure theory to minimize the effort in translating the theory into code.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, `WTP.jl` includes functions for working with nonorthogonal periodic grids and objects defined on such grids. Physically, the grids can be, for example, the reciprocal lattice or the first Brillouin Zone. Then, objects defined on grids can be the periodic part of the Bloch orbitals (defined on the reciprocal lattice) or the set of Bloch orbitals (defined on the first Brillouin zone). Last but not the least, it includes IO functionalities with the output of `pw.x` from Quantum Espresso, a popular distribution of programs for electronic structure theory.\r\n\r\nA second package, `SCDM.jl`, builds on top of `WTP.jl` and provides electron localization through two different approaches. The first is through the selected columns of the density matrix (SCDM), which is a noniterative method that has no reliance on the initial guess. The second is based on our novel variational formulation of the localized Wannier functions, which is an iterative method that takes 10-70 less iterations than `Wannier90` with the same per-iteration cost.\r\n\r\nBoth packages will be free and open source upon release.",

  "description": "Derivatives are seen as the \"easy\" part of learning calculus: a few simple rules, and every function's derivatives are at your fingertips! But these basic techniques can turn bewildering if you are faced with much more complicated functions like a matrix determinant (what is a derivative \"with respect to a matrix\" anyway?), the solution of a differential equation, or a huge engineering calculation like a fluid simulation or a neural-network model. And needing such derivatives is increasingly common thanks to the growing prevalence of machine learning, large-scale optimization, and many other problems demanding sensitivity analysis of complex calculations. Although many techniques for generalizing and applying derivatives are known, that knowledge is currently scattered across a diverse literature, and requires students to put aside their memorized rules and re-learn what a derivative really is: linearization. In 2022 and 2023, Alan and I put together a one-month, 16-hour \"Matrix Calculus\" course at MIT that refocuses differential calculus on the linear algebra at its heart, and we hope to remind you that derivatives are not a subject that is \"done\" after your second semester of calculus.",

  "description": "Symbolic learning is machine learning based on formal logic. Its peculiarity lies in the fact that the learned models enclose an **explicit knowledge representation**, which offers many opportunities:\r\n\r\n- Verifying that the model's thought process is adequate for a given task;\r\n- Learning of new insights by simple inspection of the model;\r\n- Manual refinement of the model at a later time.\r\n\r\nThese levels of **transparency** (or *interpretability*) are generally not available with standard machine learning methods, thus, as AI permeates more and more aspects of our lives, symbolic learning is becoming increasingly popular. In spite of this, implementations of symbolic algorithms (e.g, extraction of decision trees or rules) are mostly scattered across different languages and machine learning frameworks.\r\n\r\n*Enough with this!* The lesser and lesser minoritarian community of symbolic learning deserves a programming framework of its own. So, here comes [Sole.jl](https://bit.ly/3X5pQUJ), a collection of Julia packages for symbolic modeling and learning; Sole.jl covers **a relatively wide range of functionality** that is of interest for the symbolic community, but it also fills some gaps with a few functionalities for standard machine learning pipelines (e.g., feature selection on multimodal (un)structured data). At the time of writing, the framework comprehends the following released packages:\r\n\r\n+ [SoleLogics.jl](https://bit.ly/3QwLRJF) lays the **logical foundations** for symbolic learning. It provides a useful codebase for [*computational logic*](https://bit.ly/3ZOzs8a), which features easy manipulation of:\r\n\t+ Propositional and (multi)modal logics (propositions, logical constants, alphabet, grammars, fuzzy algebras);\r\n\t+ [Logical formulas](https://bit.ly/3w5tNgf) (random generation, parsing, minimization);\r\n\t+ [Logical interpretations](https://bit.ly/3w5t26M) (or models, e.g., [Kripke structures](https://bit.ly/3XbLXcc));\r\n\t+ Algorithms for [model checking](https://bit.ly/3kgAoSj) (that is, checking that a formula is satisfied by an interpretation).\r\n+ [SoleData.jl](https://bit.ly/3GYh4SF) provides a **data layer** built on top DataFrames.jl. Its codebase is machine learning oriented and allows to:\r\n\t+ Instantiate and manipulate [*multimodal*](https://bit.ly/3J7TCEj) datasets for (un)supervised machine learning;\r\n\t+ Deal with [*(un)structured* data](https://bit.ly/3ILl7mN) (e.g., graphs, images, time-series, etc.);\r\n\t+ Describe datasets via basic statistical measures;\r\n\t+ Save to/load from *npy/npz* format;\r\n\t+ Perform basic data processing operations (e.g., windowing, moving average, etc.).\r\n+ [SoleModels.jl](https://bit.ly/3GVDPqp) defines the building blocks of **symbolic modeling/learning**. It is the core of the framework, and it features:\r\n\t+ Definitions for symbolic models (decision trees/forests, rules, etc.);\r\n\t+ Optimized data structures, useful when learning models from datasets;\r\n\t+ Support for mixed, neuro-symbolic computation.\r\n\r\nAltogether, Sole.jl makes for a powerful tool built with an eye to **formal correctness**, and it can be of use for both machine learning practitioners and computational logicians.\r\n\r\n**Q:** Ok, so what symbolic learning methods do you people provide?\r\n**A:** At the moment, [ModalDecisionTrees.jl](https://github.com/aclai-lab/ModalDecisionTrees.jl) is the only package compatible with Sole.jl, and it provides novel decision tree algorithms based on multimodal temporal and spatial logics for time-series and image classification. Checkout the related [talk at JuliaCon22](https://live.juliacon.org/talk/RQP9TG).\r\n\r\n**Q:** Why the name?\r\n**A:** *Sole* stands for SymbOlic LEarning; it also means \"sun\" in Italian, a hint to the enlightening power of transparent modeling.",

Applying these techniques, we will study a few instructive examples, such as a (memory bound) streaming kernel, to understand the impact of thread pinning.

  "description": "An atmospheric transport and dispersion modeling framework for the online impact assessment of CBRN-type incidents (Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear) is currently being developed by the Royal Military Academy of Belgium and is hosted on the European Weather Cloud system. The backend of the framework is entirely written with Julia and uses [Genie.jl](https://github.com/GenieFramework/Genie.jl) to serve a REST API following the OpenApi specification (OAS). The goal of this presentation is twofold:\r\n\r\n- describing how Genie.jl has been set up along with OAS to provide authentication, API testing, DB management, server-to-client communication and routing logics,\r\n- showing the modeling ecosystem that has been built in Julia to support the framework.\r\n\r\nGenie.jl is a comprehensive framework for building full-stack web applications in Julia. Due to the complexity of this modeling framework, the computing and data management parts are decoupled from the frontend GUI, and Genie.jl is used to set up a server listening to specific routes defined and documented following the OpenApi specification. It uses [SwaggerUI.jl](https://github.com/GenieFramework/SwagUI.jl) to render a user-friendly version of the API documentation. A JSON Web Token authentication standard has been implemented to authenticate the client requests to the API, and relies on [JSONWebTokens.jl](https://github.com/felipenoris/JSONWebTokens.jl). Database management and interaction are handled by the ORM layer of Genie [SearchLight.jl](https://github.com/GenieFramework/SearchLight.jl).\r\n\r\nBesides the web development-related part of the project, various new packages for atmospheric transport and dispersion modeling have been developed, along with utility packages for geospatial computing:\r\n\r\n- [ATP45.jl](https://github.com/tcarion/ATP45.jl) is a Julia implementation of a simple military prediction procedure in case of CBRN-type incidents\r\n- [Flexpart.jl](https://github.com/tcarion/Flexpart.jl) is a Julia interface to the FLEXPART Lagrangian dispersion model. It provides the FLEXPART executable in the Julia ecosystem with BinaryBuilder.jl.\r\n- [GaussianDispersion.jl](https://github.com/tcarion/GaussianDispersion.jl) is a Julia implementation of Gaussian dispersion models.\r\n- [EcRequests.jl](https://github.com/tcarion/EcRequests.jl) interfaces the ECMWF services to retrieve weather forecast data.\r\n- [GRIBDatasets.jl](https://github.com/tcarion/GRIBDatasets.jl) provides a high-level interface to read GRIB encoded files, a widely used data format for storing meteorological fields. It has been integrated as a source for [Rasters.jl](https://github.com/rafaqz/Rasters.jl), giving a powerful way of operating on this data format in Julia.\r\n\r\nThese packages will be briefly described and some typical usage examples will be shown.",

The analysis of these data is extremely computationally demanding. Julia can have a great impact on work in Earth Observation, which mostly uses satellite-based data severely limited by traditional in-series computing (processed by computing processing units (CPUs)). Our group is developing the software package SARProcessing.jl, for the Julia programming language, which facilitates and greatly enhances the potential for carrying out work with SAR data. Our goals are to both facilitate and significantly accelerate data pipelines, making, e.g., InSAR available to a broader audience. In this talk, we will explore the functionalities of the new software package SARProcessing.jl and provide an overview of its current features.",

  "description": "[**MultilayerGraphs.jl**](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/MultilayerGraphs.jl) is a Julia package for the creation, manipulation and analysis of the structure, dynamics and functions of multilayer graphs. \r\n\r\nA multilayer graph consists of multiple subgraphs called *layers* which can be interconnected through [bipartite graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph) called *interlayers*.\r\n\r\nIn order to formally represent multilayer networks, several theoretical paradigms have been proposed (e.g. see [Bianconi (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198753919.001.0001) and [De Domenico (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-75718-2)) and adopted to model the structure and dynamics of a wide spectrum of high-dimensional, multi-scale, time-dependent complex systems including molecular, neuronal, social, ecological and economic networks (e.g. see [Amato et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-06933-2), [DeDomenico (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/gix004), [Timteo et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-02658-y), [Aleta et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-020-0931-9), [Aleta et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2112182119)).\r\n\r\nThe package features an implementation that maps a standard integer-labelled vertex representation to a more user-friendly framework exporting all the objects a practitioner would expect such as nodes, vertices, layers, interlayers, etc.\r\n\r\nMultilayerGraphs.jl has been integrated with the [JuliaGraphs](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs) and the [JuliaDynamics](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics) ecosystems through: \r\n\r\n- the extension of [Graphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/Graphs.jl) with several methods and metrics including the multilayer eigenvector centrality, the multilayer modularity and the Von Newman entropy; \r\n- the compatibility with [Agents.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/Agents.jl) allowing for agent-based modelling on general multilayer networks. \r\n\r\nIn our talk we will briefly introduce the theory and applications of multilayer graphs and showcase some of the main features of the current version of the package through a quick tutorial including: \r\n\r\n- how to install the package;\r\n- how to define layers and interlayers with a variety of constructors and underlying graphs;\r\n- how to construct a directed multilayer graph with those layers and interlayers;\r\n- how to add nodes, vertices and edges to the multilayer graph;\r\n- how to compute some standard multilayer metrics.\r\n\r\nFor a more comprehensive exploration of the package functionalities and further details on the future developments the user is invited to consult the package [README](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/MultilayerGraphs.jl/blob/main/README.md), [documentation](https://juliagraphs.org/MultilayerGraphs) and [issues](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/MultilayerGraphs.jl/issues).",

  "description": "Optimal feedback control of quantum systems plays an important role in fields such as quantum information processing and quantum sensing. Despite its relevance, however, all but the simplest quantum control problems have no known analytical solutions and even rigorous numerical approximations are usually unavailable. This can be attributed to the complex dynamics associated with quantum systems subjected to continuous observation, such as in photon counting or homodyne detection setups; these systems are described by nonlinear jump-diffusion processes.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, the use of heuristics and approximations, often based on reinforcement learning or expert intuition, is common practice for the design of quantum control policies. While these heuristics often perform remarkably well in practice, they seldom possess a mechanism to evaluate the degree of suboptimality they introduce, leaving it purely to intuition when to terminate the controller design process. We present a convex (sum-of-squares) programming-based framework for the computation of informative bounds on the best possible control performance and show how Julia's optimization ecosystem enables its implementation. We demonstrate the utility of the approach by constructing certifiably near-optimal control policies for a continuously monitored qubit.",

  "description": "The generation of inflow data for spatially developing turbulent flows is one of the challenges that must be addressed prior to the application of LES to industrial flows and complex geometries. The specification of realistic inlet boundary conditions is widely acknowledged to play a significant role in the accuracy of a numerical simulation. Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) approach needs only mean profiles for the velocity and turbulence variables, making the definition of inflow data relatively simple but the results less accurate. The generation of inflow data is much more difficult in **large-eddy** and **direct-numerical simulations**. The SEM has to be adequately tuned in order to be dependent on the turbulent intensity and to trigger the transitions to turbulence over the tested geometries in order to reproduce the experimental data. It is not advisable to use a generic white noise for creating turbulence mostly because it generates incredibly high local gradients and so the turbulence is going to be completely dissipated. \r\nThis package in a few lines allows the user to obtain a time-dependent statistically correct and coherent turbulent flow. The problem is initialized by the user setting the dimension of the inlet, the mesh size and turbulence intensity.\r\nIn the program logic, the eddies, which are coherent fluid structures, resembling the concept of vortex, are generated in a **virtual box**. This is a computational domain placed in such a way that the surface of the inlet is contained within it. In this environment, eddies are just translated, and the properties of the flow are computed on the inlet surface. \r\nThe instantaneous flow field is saved in a cache object and is updated when the user wants to advance of one time-step. Due to the customizable size of the **virtual box**, is it possible to use this package also in case of curved surfaces. \r\nThe flow properties are computed only on the points of the inlet surface. Each eddy is characterised by a single coordinate set defining the centre and an intensity level (+1, -1).\r\nThe creation of synthetic eddies relies upon mathematical and statistical definitions. More advanced users can also select between different mathematical functions adopted to generate the eddies (at the moment just the tent and Gaussian, more can be easily coded).\r\nIt has been realized in Julia because, at the moment of the development, such a method was implemented only in other programming languages. In comparison with other similar projects (in Python or Fortran), there is less code and the use is straightforward. Furthermore, it is really close to the mathematical notation and it makes it easier to understand by future contributors.\r\nFinally, the results of the package have been tested. The spectral analysis shows that the flow field generated shows the expected turbulence characteristics. The final achievement will be to couple the turbulence generation with the FEM solver for incompressible flows.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this package can be widely adopted in the field of fluid dynamics for obtaining more realistic and accurate results.\r\n\r\nPackage repository: https://github.com/carlodev/SyntheticEddyMethod.jl",

  "description": "Long-range dependence has been a topic of interest in time series analysis since Granger's study on the shape of the spectrum of economic variables. The author found that long-term fluctuations in data, if decomposed into frequency components, are such that the amplitudes of the components decrease smoothly with decreasing periods. This type of dynamics implies long-lasting autocorrelations; that is, they exhibit long-range dependence. Long-range dependence has been estimated in temperature data, political affiliation data, financial volatility measures, inflation, and energy prices, to name a few. Moreover, it has been shown that the presence of long-range dependence on data can have perverse effects on statistical methods if not included in the modelling scheme.  \r\n\r\nThis talk presents a package for modelling long-range dependence in the data. We develop methods to model long-range dependence by the commonly used fractional difference operator and the theoretically based cross-sectional aggregation scheme. The fast Fourier transform and recursive implementations of the algorithms are used to speed up computations. The proposed algorithms are exact in the sense that no approximation of the number of aggregating units is needed. We show that the algorithms can be used to reduce computational times for all sample sizes. \r\n\r\nMoreover, estimators in the frequency domain are developed to test for long-range dependence in the data. A broad range of estimators are considered: the original Geweke and Porter-Hudak (GPH) estimator, local Whittle (LW) variants that allow for non-de-meaned data, bias-reduced versions of both GPH and LW methods, and Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLE) in the frequency domain for the fractional differenced and cross-sectional aggregated data. For the latter, the profile likelihood is obtained for efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe proposed package is simple to implement in real applications. In particular, we present an exercise using temperature data modelled using standard and long-range dependence models. The experiment shows that the standard model misrepresents the prediction confidence intervals of future global temperatures. The misrepresentation can potentially explain some of the previous underestimations of temperature increases in the last decades.",

LRD has been found in climate, political affiliation and finance data, to name a few examples."

  "description": "Inertial confinement fusion (ICF) seeks to initiate fusion by using multiple high-power, nanosecond laser beams to compress and implode a millimeter-scale spherical target filled with deuterium-tritium (DT) fuel. Implosions are designed to increase the pressure and density of the fuel high enough such that DT fusion occurs and releases excess energy.\r\n\r\nSimulating ICF experiments presents an extreme challenge and requires combining multiple physics models including multi-material hydrodynamics, nonlinear heat conduction, laser ray-tracing, and radiation transfer. Multi-physics codes are traditionally written in Fortran or C++ for performance, and are occasionally combined with a scripting language interface (such as Python) for user interactivity. Julia provides a compelling alternative to this model by improving developer productivity without sacrificing code performance.\r\n\r\nCygnus was written as part of a doctoral dissertation to simulate the impact of micron-scale defects embedded in the plastic outer-shell of ICF targets. Cygnus combines finite-volume hydrodynamics with non-linear thermal conduction and laser energy deposition on a domain-decomposed block structured mesh. Methods of parallelization (e.g., multi-threaded loops, BlockHaloArrays.jl), code design, performance characterizations (roofline model and strong scaling), and lessons learned will be presented alongside simulation results.\r\n\r\nThis material is based upon work supported by the Department of Energy National Nuclear Security Administration under Award Number DE-NA0003856, the University of Rochester, and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.",

  "description": "A full quantum mechanical treatment of open quantum systems via a Master equation is often limited by the size of the underlying Hilbert space. As an alternative, the dynamics can also be formulated in terms of systems of coupled differential equations for operators in the Heisenberg picture. This typically leads to an infinite hierarchy of equations for products of operators. A well-established approach to truncate this infinite set at the level of expectation values is to neglect quantum correlations of high order. This is systematically realized with a so-called cumulant expansion, which decomposes expectation values of operator products into products of a given lower order, leading to a closed set of equations. Here we present an open-source framework that fully automizes this approach: first, the equations of motion of operators up to a desired order are derived symbolically using predefined canonical commutation relations. Next, the resulting equations for the expectation values are expanded employing the cumulant expansion approach, where moments up to a chosen order specified by the user are included. Finally, a numerical solution can be directly obtained from the symbolic equations. After reviewing the theory we present the framework and showcase its usefulness in a few example problems.",

While detailed models enable high fidelity simulations, they pose challenges for analysis. Engineers often resort to linear analysis to perform tasks such as mode analysis to determine vibration patterns and closed-loop analysis of control systems to determine stability and performance properties.\r\n\r\nThis talk details the work that has been done over the last year enabling linear analysis of ModelingToolkit models. We start by talking about the linearization itself, and the subsequent simplification of models with algebraic equations into standard linear statespace models.

  "description": "Jump and point processes share many similarities despite their somewhat independent developments. JumpProcesses.jl was first developed for simulating jump processes via stochastic simulation algorithms (SSAs) (including Doob’s method, Gillespie’s methods, and Kinetic Monte Carlo methods). Historically, jump processes have been developed in the context of dynamical systems with the objective of describing dynamics with discrete jumps. In contrast, the development of point processes has been more focused in describing the occurrence of random events. In this talk we bridge the gap between the treatment of point and jump process simulation. The algorithms previously included in JumpProcesses.jl can be mapped to three general methods developed in statistics for simulating evolutionary point processes. Our comparative exercise reveals that the library originally lacked an efficient algorithm for simulating processes with variable intensity rates. We therefore extended JumpProcesses.jl with a new simulation algorithm, Coevolve, that enables the rapid simulation of processes with locally-bounded variable intensity rates. It is now poosible to efficiently simulate any point process on the real-line with a non-negative, left-continuous, history-adapted and locally bounded intensity rate. This extension significantly improves the computational performance of JumpProcesses.jl when simulating such processes, enabling it to become one of the only readily available, fast, general purpose libraries for simulating evolutionary point processes.",

  "description": "Using Single Cell RNA sequencing, it is today possible to generate data sets with gene expressions levels for >30k genes and hundreds of thousands of cells.\r\nExplorative analysis of these rich data sets is important - but challenging using existing tools that store the transformed and normalized data as dense matrices. (A single dense matrix with 30k genes and 500k cells takes 120GB RAM.)\r\nSingleCellProjections.jl is the first comprehensive Julia Package for processing Single Cell Expression data.\r\nIt is at least 5 times faster and uses less than 1/5 of the memory, when doing the same analysis as existing packages written in other languages.\r\n\r\nSingleCellProjections.jl supports the standard workflow for Single Cell Expression data:\r\nSparse matrices with raw gene expressions counts (~5-10% nonzeros) are transformed (e.g. using SCTransform or log transform) and then normalized (e.g. mean-center, regress out covariates).\r\nNext, a truncated SVD (i.e. Principal Component Analysis) is computed to bring the data down from 30k dimensions to ~100 dimensions, which also serves as noise reduction.\r\nThis is a great starting point for downstream analysis, partly because the data set is now much smaller.\r\nUMAP and t-SNE visualization are supported using external packages, and Force Layout (also known as SPRING plot) support is built-in.\r\n\r\nAs the name indicates, SingleCellProjections.jl is also built for projections.\r\nA common use case is that there is good, well-annotated reference data set (e.g. healthy cells), that the user wants to relate their own, newly generated data set (e.g. cancer cells) to.\r\nBy projecting the new data onto the reference data set, similarities and differences can be interpreted in terms of the reference data set.\r\nProjection is here used in a broad sense, describing all steps after loading the raw count data until the analysis is done.\r\nComputing the projection in SingleCellProjections.jl is very simple:\r\n```\r\nnew_data = load_counts(filepaths)\r\nproject(new_data, base)\r\n```\r\nUnder the hood, SingleCellProjections.jl has stored a `ProjectionModel` for each analysis step that was applied to the base data set, with all the information needed to compute the projection for that step, and applies the models one by one to project the new data.\r\nNote that projecting is rarely the same as running the same analysis step independently, as the model is built from the source data.\r\nThis can be subtle and easy to forget, but the simple interface hides this complexity from the user, minimizing the risk for mistakes.\r\nAt the same time, it is easy to customize some steps if needed.\r\n\r\nThe key to performance and low memory usage in SingleCellProjections.jl is to never store large, dense matrices.\r\nInstead, matrix expressions are created and manipulated to implicitly represent the same information internally.\r\nAs a motivating example, consider a sparse matrix `S` and let `A := S - m1ᵀ` be the matrix after mean-centering.\r\nHere, `m` is a vector with the mean for each gene (variable) and `1` is a vector of ones.\r\nSingleCellProjections.jl avoids materializing the large dense matrix `A` by working with the expression object directly.\r\nThis strategy generalizes to more advanced transforms and normalizations, yielding slightly more complicated matrix expressions, consisting of sparse and/or low-rank terms and factors.\r\nContinuing the example from above, note that it is much more efficient to compute `AX` for some matrix `X` by distributing over the sum and evaluating `SX - m(1ᵀX)`, than to work with the materialized matrix `A`.\r\nRandomized subspace iterations (Halko et al) are used to compute the truncated SVD (i.e. PCA), relying only on such matrix-matrix products.\r\nTo efficiently compute the matrix-matrix products, SingleCellProjections.jl internally solves a generalized Matrix Chain Multiplication problem, taking both size and structure of the matrices into account.\r\n\r\nJulia is very well suited for working with complicated, high-dimensional, biological data.\r\nIn particular, the ability to write both high level code and efficient low-level code has been immensely useful when implementing this package.\r\nReproducibility, which is very important for scientific analyses, is also greatly improved by Julia - in part by Manifests, but also by execution speed, since the user is more likely to rerun an analysis rather than loading some partial result from disk.\r\nWe hope that SingleCellReductions.jl is a good starting point for anyone who wants to perform Single Cell expressions analyses and benefit from the Julia language and its ecosystem.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nHalko et al, \"Finding Structure with Randomness: Probabilistic Algorithms for Constructing Approximate Matrix Decompositions\"",

  "description": "As we embrace the era of exascale computing, scalable performance and fast development on extremely heterogeneous hardware have become ever more important aspects for high-performance computing (HPC). Scientists and developers with interest in Julia for HPC need to know how to leverage the capabilities of the  language and ecosystem to address these issues and which tools and best practices can help them to achieve their performance goals.\r\n\r\nWhat do we mean by HPC? While HPC can be mainly associated with running large-scale physical simulations like computational fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics, high-energy physics, climate models etc., we use a more inclusive definition beyond the scope of computational science and engineering. More recently, rapid prototyping with high-productivity languages like Julia, machine learning training, data management, computer science research, research software engineering, large scale data visualization and in-situ analysis have expanded the scope for defining HPC. For us, the core of HPC is not to run simple test problems faster but involves everything that enables solving challenging problems in simulation or data science, on heterogeneous hardware platforms, from a high-end workstation to the world's largest supercomputers powered with different vendors CPUs and accelerators (e.g. GPUs).\r\n\r\nIn this three-hour minisymposium, we will give an overview of the current state of affairs of Julia for HPC in a series of ~10-minute talks. The focus of these overview talks is to introduce and motivate the audience by highlighting aspects making the Julia language beneficial for scientific HPC workflows such as scalable deployments, compute accelerator support, user support, and HPC applications. In addition, we have reserved some time for participants to interact, discuss and share the current landscape of their investments in Julia HPC, while encouraging networking with their colleagues over topics of common interest.\r\n\r\n### Minisymposium Schedule\r\n\r\n* 10:30: Carsten Bauer (PC2) & Samuel Omlin (CSCS): Welcome and Overview\r\n\r\n**Part I (Scaling Applications)**\r\n\r\n* 10:40: Ludovic Räss (ETHZ): Scalability and HPC readiness of Julia’s AMD GPU stack\r\n\r\n* 10:55: Dominik Kiese (Flatiron Institute): Large-scale vertex calculations in condensed matter physics with Julia\r\n\r\n* 11:10: Michael Schlottke-Lakemper (RWTH Aachen) & Hendrik Ranocha (U Hamburg): Scaling Trixi.jl to more than 10,000 cores using MPI\r\n\r\n* 11:25: Q&A\r\n\r\n* 11:30: Short break\r\n\r\n**Part II (Performance Evaluation & Tuning)**\r\n\r\n* 11:40: William F Godoy (ORNL): Julia programming models evaluation on Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facilities: Summit and Frontier\r\n\r\n* 11:55: Mosé Giordano (UCL): MPI, SVE, 16-bit: using Julia on the fastest supercomputer\r\n\r\n* 12:10: Carsten Bauer (PC2): HPC Tools for Julia: Inspecting, Monitoring, and Tuning Performance\r\n\r\n* 12:25: Q&A\r\n\r\n* 12:30: Time for lunch 😉\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Lunch break (1:30h)**\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Part III (Ecosystem Developments)**\r\n\r\n* 2:00: Tim Besard (Julia Computing): Update on oneAPI.jl developments\r\n\r\n* 2:15: Julian Samaroo (MIT): Dagger in HPC: GPUs, MPI, and Profiling at great speed\r\n\r\n* 2:30: Johannes Blaschke (NERSC): Improvements to Distributed.jl for HPC\r\n\r\n* 2:45: Q&A\r\n\r\n* 3:00: Fin.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the minisymposium is to identify and summarize current practices, limitations, and future developments as Julia experiences growth and positions itself in the larger HPC community due to its appeal in scientific computing. It also exemplifies the strength of the existing Julia HPC community that collaboratively prepared this event. We are an international, multi institutional, and multi disciplinary group interested in advancing Julia for HPC applications in our academic and national laboratory environments. We would like to welcome new people from multiple backgrounds sharing our interest and bring them together in this minisymposium.\r\n\r\nIn this spirit, the minisymposium will serve as a starting point for further Julia HPC activities at JuliaCon 2023. During the main conference, a Birds of Feather session will provide an opportunity to bring together the community for more discussions and to allow new HPC users to join the conversation. Furthermore, a number of talks will be dedicated to topics relevant for HPC developers and users alike.",

  "description": "The Julia ecosystem has been developed as a powerful open-source language, but it currently lacks some infrastructure typically required by regulatory agencies to be seen as a reproducible and dependable open-source platform for submission-quality work within the highly regulated biomedical field. For Julia to be a truly open-source platform it needs infrastructure for pharmacometric and QSP analyses like the \"how to document that this platform is “validated\" as R has done (https://www.r-project.org/doc/R-FDA.pdf) \", a package for routinely incorporating inputs like dosing events and other \"covariates\", model library(ies), general (traceable and reproducible) modeling workflows and best practices, model specification approaches, package testing, functional outputs, etc. The open-source community should not have to rely on commercial entities to supply such infrastructure, nor is a viable open-source language healthy, under those circumstances. \r\n\r\nThe authors have been working, with others in the field, to develop models and some of the aforementioned workflows and infrastructure to produce submission-quality analyses within the open-source and open-science Julia ecosystem. A classic set of monoclonal antibody-drug conjugate Physiologically Based PK (PBPK)/tumor dynamics systems models have been implemented, parameterized, and exercised (through simulation) to illustrate such a reproducible workflow. The background behind the models and the Julia scripts used to develop and visualize the models and processing will be presented as a step-by-step “how-to” guide for deploying a reproducible open-science Julia workflow. A github page with the details and codes behind this vignette will also be provided to the public, in the spirit of knowledge sharing.",

The goal with this talk is to use a simple implementation of the algebra to explain the main features. No prior knowledge of geometric (aka Clifford) algebra will be assumed and by the end the audience should have a basic understanding of the properties of the geometric product - the key basis for the algebra. A novel implementation of this product in terms of binary operations will also be discussed. All of the SimpleGA source code is available, and there are many excellent free resources on geometric algebra for those interested in diving deaeper.",

  "description": "**Purpose:** The Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) ecosystem in Julia holds great potential for applications in the field of systems biology. Much of this potential can be attributed to fast ODE solvers and parameter estimation packages, and convenient interface with neural differential equations and systems biology standards/formats. While an increasing number of systems biology groups are starting to use Julia to address biological questions, many existing systems biology tools are not yet available in Julia.\r\n\r\nIn this Birds of Feather discussion we want to address the following questions:\r\n1. What are the community needs, plans and visions?\r\n2. Which existing systems biology tools hold great potential for faster implementations if ported to Julia?\r\n3. Which new tools are enabled by the features of the SciML ecosystem.\r\n4. Where can we find synergies and common interests for joining efforts on systems biology tool development?\r\n5. (How) can we improve on the existing communication channels to facilitate coordinated and collaborative tool development.\r\n\r\n**Significance:** Bringing key players in the field of open-source systems biology tool development at one table to discuss the above questions will facilitate a flourishing ecosystem of systems biology tools and pipelines in Julia, and increase the uptake of the language by the community as a consequence.\r\n\r\n**Agenda:** the following points will be on the agenda.\r\n- ~5 min: Introduction by Paul Lang or Anand Jain\r\n- ~15 min: Every participant briefly addresses question (1) from above from their perspective\r\n- ~50 min: Participants are split up into 2-5 groups to discuss questions (2)-(5) from above.\r\n- ~15 min: One member of each group summarizes the main points from the group discussion for the other groups.\r\n- ~5 min: Closing remarks by Paul Lang and Anand Jain\r\n- (Optional if time is left: Talking to people from other discussion groups and unguided networking.)\r\n\r\nA short document summarizing the Birds of Feather discussion may be published on Twitter, Discourse and the sysbio-sciml Slack channel on the Julia workspace for the broader community by the end of August.\r\n\r\n**Moderators**: Paul Lang and Anand Jain",

However, what is considered natural can vary from user to user.

Tradeoffs between such alternative modeling formats are further amplified when dual solutions are considered. In this talk we describe work related to these tradeoffs in JuMP.

  "description": "Most electronic music synthesis software today is written in C/C++. This is usually due to the performance requirements that are necessary in this domain. The use of Julia however brings two distinct advantages to this area. \r\n\r\nFirst, using a high level, dynamic programming language, allows for a wider and more productive range of experimentation. The use of Julia allows for the performance characteristics to me met, while working in an easy to use language. Second, the wide range of high quality mathematical libraries in Julia, from FFT to differential equation solvers, allows for the use of high level constructs, further increasing the productivity of the artist. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we show a set of fundamental building blocks for music synthesis in Julia. From wave generators to filters to  amplifiers, we will see how these can be built with simple Julia functions, leveraging the existing ecosystem. We will show that Julia's ability to build abstractions without sacrificing performance is crucial to this use case.",

  "description": "One of the important application areas for Julia lies in statistics. Dataset sizes have exploded, thus creating demands on high performance. In addition, there are elegant possibilities to harness the language foundations of Julia to create useful abstractions and better code reuse. In this mini-symposium, we report on some of this progress. The minisymposium will feature:\r\n\r\n1. Julia for statistics by Ajay Shah\r\n\r\nAn overview talk with a sense of the landscape.\r\n\r\n2. Survey.jl: a package for studying complex survey data by Iulia Dimitru, Shikhar Mishra, Ayush Patnaik\r\n\r\nHandling complex survey data is an important problem in statistics, and the authors have made considerable progress in building an elegant Julia package that has many of the most-used capabilities.\r\n\r\n3. CRRao.jl: A consistent API for many useful models by Sourish Das\r\n\r\nStudents and practitioners find their path into statistical modelling is eased by using the consistent framework of CRRao.jl.\r\n\r\n4. TSFrames.jl by Chirag Anand\r\n\r\nTime series data is ubiquitous, and can benefit from specialised functions and user abstractions. The TSFrames.jl package fills this need.\r\n\r\nWe expect a 20 minute talk by each of these 4 which adds up to 80 minutes. \r\n\r\nThis will be a simplified version of the Statistics in Julia symposium that was in Juliacon 2022 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fewunew8wU4). It reflects the areas in which good new work has happened in the past year. Of course, the material in the minisymposium will be self-contained: it will target a new viewer, it will not be produced as a diff on the previous one.",

  "description": "The Curricular Analytics toolbox is designed to support meaningful interaction between the academic core and administrative shell of an institution. It also serves as a tool for researchers to easily investigate research questions around curricular design and for faculty to examine alternative curricular pathways. The toolbox is currently at the center of a three-year project in collaboration with the Association for Undergraduate Education at Research Universities (UERU), formerly the Reinvention Collaborative, and funded by the Ascendium Education Group, which seeks to validate the relationship between curricular complexity and student success.\r\n\r\nWe first introduce the curricular analytics framework, which we've implemented in Julia, and involves decomposing curricular complexity into two independent parts: instructional complexity and structural complexity. The toolbox also allows for simulating student progression through various curricula adjusting for both measures of complexity. Additionally, we demonstrate the one-to-many relationship between curricula and degree plans and examine why some plans might be better than others. This includes highlighting the degree plan optimization capabilities we've developed, and how this relates to transfer articulation between institutions and the associated equity implications of the transfer process.\r\n\r\nFinally, we speak to the broader social implications of the toolbox and how it may inform a broader, more comprehensive, causal model of student success. Specifically, how may the tool guide change management within institutions, and can it empower faculty in their ownership of the curriculum?",

There is already a vibrant ecosystem of quantum-related Julia packages and users and developers at a variety of career stages: high school, undergraduate, and graduate students; postdoctoral scholars; faculty; staff scientists; and industry researchers and developers. In these conjoined minisymposia, the community would be able to present their work to a quantum-focused audience, allowing package developers to present material more relevant to an expert audience (which is often not really appropriate for the wider JuliaCon audience), more junior community members to find mentors in their area, and allowing community members working in different areas to find areas of common interest or need.\r\n\r\nFor example, the minisymposium might contain a talk about tensor network methods in condensed matter physics, and another talk about these methods as applied to quantum circuit simulation, allowing developers in both areas to understand where current Julia implementations are lacking and find new contributors. Having a dedicated stream (minisymposia) for this kind of talk would facilitate this kind of interaction.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a quantum-focused series of minisymposia would allow the \"quantum curious\" -- students, those in industry but without a background in the relevant fields -- to see the \"lay of the land\" and find opportunities to contribute, for research, or for job searches.\r\n\r\nWe propose a double or conjoined minisymposium -- one session in the morning, one in the afternoon -- because of the breadth of the community and the wide variety of use cases and fields of study covered. Two sessions will allow us to include enough full length talks to treat each area fairly, as even with much background in common, a full length talk is often needed to treat a topic in the \"quantum\" area in sufficient depth.

  "description": "Modern machine learning relies heavily on rapidly training and evaluating neural networks in problems ranging from image classification to robotic control. However, most existing neural network architectures have no robustness certificates, making them sensitive to even small input perturbations and highly susceptible to poor data quality, adversarial attacks, and other forms of input disturbances. The few neural network architectures proposed in recent years that offer solutions to this brittle behaviour rely on explicitly enforcing constraints during training to “smooth” the network response. These methods are computationally expensive, making them slow and difficult to scale up to complex real-world problems.\r\n\r\nRecently, we proposed the Recurrent Equilibrium Network (REN) architecture as a computationally efficient solution to these problems. The REN architecture is flexible in that it includes all commonly used neural network models, such as fully-connected networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. The weight matrices and bias vectors in a REN are directly parameterised to naturally satisfy behavioural constraints chosen by the user. For example, the user can build a REN with a given Lipschitz constant to ensure the output of the network is quantifiably less sensitive to unexpected input perturbations. Other common options include contracting RENs and input/output passive RENs. \r\n\r\nThe direct parameterisation of RENs means that no additional constrained optimization methods are needed to train the networks to be less sensitive to attacks or perturbations. We can therefore train RENs with standard, unconstrained optimization methods (such as gradient descent) while also guaranteeing their robustness. Achieving the “best of both worlds” in this way is unique to our REN model class, and allows us to freely train RENs for common machine learning problems as well as more difficult applications where safety and robustness are critical.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present our RobustNeuralNetworks.jl package. The package is built around the AbstractREN type, encoding the REN model class. It relies heavily on key features of the Julia language (such as multiple dispatch) for a neat, efficient implementation of RENs, and can be used alongside Flux.jl to solve machine learning problems with and without robustness requirements, all in native Julia. \r\n\r\nWe will give a brief introduction to the fundamental theory behind our direct parameterisation of neural networks, and outline what we mean by nonlinear robustness. We will follow this with a detailed overview of the RobustNeuralNetworks.jl package structure, including the key types and methods used to construct and implement a REN. To conclude, we will demonstrate some interesting applications of our Julia package for REN in our own research, including in:\r\n\r\n- Image classification\r\n- System identification\r\n- Learning-based control for dynamical systems\r\n- Real-time control of robotic systems via the Julia C API\r\n\r\nUltimately, we hope to show how RENs will be useful to the wider Julia machine learning community in both research and industry applications. For more information on the REN model class and its uses, please see our two recent papers https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05942 and https://doi.org/10.1109/LCSYS.2022.3184847.",

  "description": "At the core of the PRONTO algorithm is a nonlinear projection operator which maps curves to the system's trajectory manifold. Encoding the dynamics constraint through this operator creates an unconstrained optimization problem which is then solved via Newton descent. In the best case, PRONTO can achieve quadratic convergence. PRONTO has proven to be an effective tool for solving large quantum control problems, finding optimal satellite maneuvers, and studying the dynamics of high-performance vehicles.\r\n\r\nIn spite of its efficacy, previously existing implementations of PRONTO had a substantial learning curve. The algorithm requires the definition of Jacobians and Hessians of the dynamics and cost functions, all of which needed to be manually implemented in C++. Systems with tens of states necessitated the calculation of hundreds of derivatives - this process was rather work intensive and would often lead to mistakes hidden deep in byzantine code. Further analysis of results was typically done in MATLAB, and this two-language approach made it difficult to gain insights on some aspects of the algorithm's behavior. A pure MATLAB implementation of PRONTO was performance limited to small systems at low resolutions.\r\n\r\nTo increase the accessibility and usability of this powerful algorithm without sacrificing performance, Julia was a natural choice. Initially, we were expecting to accept a small reduction in performance in exchange for dramatically increased usability. However, thanks to insights gleaned from an array of profiling and code introspection tools created by the Julia community, we were able to not just match the performance of the C++ implementation, but substantially exceed it.\r\n\r\nThe majority of computations in the PRONTO algorithm consist of solving a series of about 10 ODEs, some forward, and some backward in time. Consequently, the performance of the internal ODE solver is extremely important. Rather than being limited to an explicit Runge-Kutta (4,5) algorithm, in PRONTO.jl we make use of the power and flexibility of DifferentialEquations.jl, and can adjust algorithms and settings to suit the requirements of the problem. Furthermore, the solver-aware interpolation methods used by DifferentialEquations.jl result in a more efficient representation of each ODE solution, storing less data while being more accurate and requiring fewer extra solution steps than a fixed-step linear interpolation.\r\n\r\nPRONTO.jl utilizes the symbolic differentiation provided by Symbolics.jl to compute the necessary Jacobians and Hessians, and the resulting functions are then fine-tuned using Julia's metaprogramming and expression manipulation functionalities. Since PRONTO.jl can automatically generate substantial portions of its own code, the user only needs to provide 5 functions: the dynamics, stage and terminal costs, and a pair of regulator matrices. This greatly reduces the burden on the user, reduces implementation errors, and results in more readable code. Ultimately, this substantially cuts down on the time required to implement new models, which can now be spent exploring novel problems.\r\n\r\nPRONTO.jl enables us to study a set of problems that were previously prohibitively difficult to implement, and more importantly makes this powerful tool accessible to a broader research community. We hope it will enable some exciting research!\r\n\r\nPRONTO.jl is available at https://github.com/narijauskas/PRONTO.jl and we expect to add it to the general registry in the near future.",

We will begin by discussing the importance of quadrotors in various fields and the need for precise control. Next, we will delve into building a quadrotor model using the ModellingToolkit.jl package. You will learn about the advantages of using nonlinear geometric control methods over traditional linear control techniques.\r\n\r\nAfter building the model, we will perform a simulation to visualize the control of the quadrotor. The simulation results will be animated using Makie.jl, a powerful visualization package in Julia. You will see the quadrotor's trajectories in real-time, which will help you understand how the control inputs affect the motion of the quadrotor.\r\n\r\nThroughout the talk, you will learn about the Julia packages and the concepts used in simulating and visualizing geometric control.

  "description": "We implement methods for box-constrained optimization problems: `min_x f(x) s.t. l <= x <= u`. This class of problems is relevant in its own right, but frequently appears as a sub-routine of nonlinearly constrained optimization methods, such as penalty or barrier algorithms.\r\n\r\nProgradio makes use of Julia's `Iterator` interface, allowing greater control at each iteration (pausing, resuming, user-defined termination criteria). This feature (which most solvers lack) truly allows the solvers to be used as sub-routines to other algorithms. The traditional `solve()` interface is also available.\r\n\r\nSince `v0.1`, we have implemented a stricter line-search algorithm. In addition to the existing Armijo method, this Wolfe-like procedure uses left and right-derivative information for the step-size selection. A more accurate line-search results in a higher rate of convergence, at the expense of the added derivative evaluations.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we have added support for problems with simplex constraints (Σ x_j = 1). This is achieved with a transformation of variables at each iteration. The added constraint is effectively handled by a modified line-search, while ensuring feasibility at every iteration.\r\n\r\nProgradio's early-termination and feasibility capabilities are attractive for infinite-dimensional optimization, such as solving optimal control problems.\r\n\r\nWe give examples of how dynamic optimization packages in our JuDO-dev organization call Progradio's solvers as sub-routines.",

  "description": "Best practices had to be developed to make the most of a new language in the development of Earth system models. Newer concepts in research software engineering find their way into the Earth system modelling community, particularly through the adoption of new languages. And the user demand on interfaces and interoperability to these models also has changed. \r\n\r\nWith custom types a domain specific language is created within our models and abstraction minimizes code redundancy. Ideally we would like to execute the same code on all computing architectures at high performance, but what are the best practices to achieve that? Earth system models are large with many interoperating parts. How can we build them with a flexibility that any user can swap in and out parts without diving deep into the code base? And we are aiming towards differentiable models that learn from data, ideally without sacrificing anything from above. This minisymposium aims to cover the following topics, but is not limited to\r\n\r\n- Abstraction, multiple dispatch, types and type hierarchies in large projects\r\n- Flexibility with respect to the computing architecture: CPUs, GPUs, and others\r\n- Modularity: easily extendible models and their components\r\n- Differentiability and optimization: Learning from data\r\n- Integration of Julia’s machine learning frameworks into models\r\n- Performance: Achieving and monitoring performance during development\r\n- Usage of high-performance and parallelism frameworks\r\n- Interconnectivity of packages across the Julia ecosystem\r\n- Bad practices: Julia’s detours, unnecessary complexity, or missing features\r\n\r\nPotential projects to be presented:\r\n\r\n- ClimaAtmos.jl and other projects in the CliMA framework\r\n- Oceananigans.jl\r\n- SpeedyWeather.jl\r\n- dJUICE.jl\r\n- ClimateModels.jl\r\n- ClimateTools.jl\r\n- NCDatasets.jl\r\n- DiskArrays.jl\r\n\r\nChair: Milan Klöwer (MIT);\r\nCo-chairs: Simon Byrne (Caltech), Chris Hill (MIT)",

  "description": "ENLSIP, which stands for Easy Nonlinear Least-Squares Inequality Program and available at https://plato.asu.edu/sub/nonlsq.html#lsqres, is the name of an optimization algorithm and an open-source Fortran77 library developed and released in the 1980s that solves nonlinear least squares problems under nonlinear constraints using a Gauss-Newton type method.\r\n\r\nThis library has been successfully used for decades by Hydro-Québec, the main electricity supplier for the province of Quebec in Canada, to calibrate its short-term electricity demand forecast models, also coded in Fortran. Since Hydro-Québec is starting to switch from Fortran to Julia and because its systems are used in a very critical context, the first goal of this transition is to ensure that the replacing Julia version reproduce the results given by the original Fortran version. The Julia conversion of the above-mentioned ENLSIP library is part of this process. Comparison of results and performance on operational Hydro-Québec optimization problems have been performed thanks to a Julia-Fortran interface and show very encouraging results, which leads us to think that the current version of our implementation can be published as a Julia package. \r\n\r\nWe recognize that this algorithm does not beneficiate from state-of-the-art least-squares optimization improvements, but we think using it can still be relevant nowadays. Indeed, its application remains very general covering non-linearity and non-convexity of the constraints and objective function. This category of least-squares problems is seldom mentioned in the literature compared to other ones such as linear cases without constraints for instance. The second part of this project is to improve the optimization method and we hope the release of this package and its eventual use by the community can help us gathering improvements useful to all.",

  "description": "Molecular dynamics (MD) is a computational method for simulating microscopic motions of  atoms in a system, in order to understand macroscopic properties of the system. One of the main uses of MD is in computational drug discovery, where simulating a target protein with a candidate drug (ligand) allows one to predict their binding affinity before conducting expensive wet-lab experiments. MD computations are by no means cheap: to get meaningful results multi-day simulations on high-performance machines are often necessary. For that reason, most popular MD engines are written and performance engineered in C++ in order to make best use of the hardware.\r\n\r\nBiosimMD.jl is wholly written in Julia, which made it possible to match and surpass the performance of state-of-the-art C++ engines. The package makes extensive use of the ability to access low-level compiler and CPU features e.g. SIMD operations. At the same time, the ability to test new algorithms at a high level made it possible to quickly research and prototype the best performing code. The package also heavily relies on Julia’s metaprogramming, greatly reducing the size and the complexity of the codebase.\r\n\r\nThe design of BiosimMD.jl enables users to implement custom MD methods without compromising simulation speed and modifying BiosimMD’s internal code. One example is the use of machine learning during the simulation on-the-fly. A challenge in MD is the design of high-quality force-fields, the set of parameters that determines how the atoms move in a simulation. While there are good off-the-shelf force-fields for proteins, that is not the case for ligands (candidate drugs). We have implemented a package, MoleculeMD.jl, which integrates with BiosimMD.jl in a few lines of code, providing a machine-learnt force field trained on accurate and extensive quantum chemistry data. BiosimMD.jl provides an interface for  implementing a wide array of similar techniques.\r\n\r\nCurrently, BiosimMD.jl is implemented and optimized for Intel and AMD CPUs. In future, a GPU implementation will also be available. There is also an accompanying package to import molecular systems from popular MD engines such as Gromacs and OpenMM.",

  "description": "StochasticAD.jl is an open-source research package for automatic differentiation (AD) of stochastic programs. The particular focus is on implementing AD algorithms for handling programs that can contain *discrete* randomness. But what does this even mean?\r\n\r\nDerivatives are all about how functions are affected by a tiny change ε in their input. For example, take the function sin(x). Perturb x by ε, and the output changes by approximately cos(x) * ε: tiny change in, tiny change out. And the coefficient cos(x)? That's the derivative!\r\n\r\nBut what happens if your function is discrete and random? For example, take a Bernoulli variable, with probability p of being 1 and probability 1-p of being 0. If we perturb p by ε, *the output of the Bernoulli variable cannot change by a tiny amount*. But in the probabilistic world, there is another way to change by a tiny amount *on average*: jump by a large amount, with tiny probability. \r\n\r\nStochasticAD.jl generalizes the well-known concept of [dual numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_number) by including a *third* component to describe large perturbations with infinitesimal probability. The resulting object is called a *stochastic triple*, and StochasticAD.jl develops the algorithms to propagate this triple through user-written code involving discrete randomness. Ultimately, the result is a *provably unbiased* estimate of the derivative of your program, even if it contains discrete randomness!\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will discuss the workings of StochasticAD.jl, including the underlying theory and the technical implementation challenges.",

  "description": "An [order book](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/order-book.asp) is an electronic list of buy and sell orders for a specific security. Order books, which are maintained for each security traded on an exchange, catalog orders based upon the time and price the entry was received and use different matching algorithms to match buyers and sellers for a particular security. , which can also be used to help illustrate the dynamics for that security. Thus, order books, and their associated matching algorithms, play an essential role in determining the price at which a trade is executed. Order books can also be used as a measure of the supply and demand dynamics for a security. \r\n\r\nThe following section will briefly discuss this package's origins and how we modified and extended its features. Finally, we will provide a system evaluation and validation.\r\n\r\n**Where does this package come from?**\r\nThis package is based on [LimitOrderBook.jl](https://github.com/p-casgrain/LimitOrderBook.jl), which previously implemented the submission and cancellation of market orders and limit orders. It also provided information regarding the order book, such as the depth of the book, total bid/ask volume, and best bid/ask prices. However, several things could have been improved with the original package. Toward these issues, we fixed several order matching and account tracking issues present in the original package. Further, we extended the package to include additional order types, such as stop-loss orders and buy-stop orders. We also implemented functionality to load or persist the state of the entire order book as a comma-separated value (CSV) file. Finally, we are working on functionality to integrate the book with the order submission process. A notification feature is being added to notify the client/broker regarding order status; for example, when a limit order is submitted, it may only get matched after some time. If matched, the matching engine will notify listeners that the limited order has been executed. \r\n\r\n**How do we maintain this package?**\r\nVLLimitOrderBook.jl is maintained on the Varnerlab GitHub site at Cornell University. The code is available under an MIT software license. \r\n\r\n**Evaluation and Validation**\r\nWe are implementing a set of performance benchmarks. We measure throughput by submitting or canceling orders concurrently or sequentially. We also measure the time required to process an order from submission to completion of the matching process. Finally, to validate the accuracy and correctness of the order book simulation, we are working with [Polygon](https://polygon.io/), a leading market data provider, to compare simulated historical book data for a variety of assets, including equity, options, and cryptocurrency.",

  "description": "Julia's packages usually compose well with each other. Hence it is common to see people using different packages together. It is often a design choice to split work across different packages.  \r\n\r\nOften, users add all the packages used in a tutorial or documentation to a local environment; end up with different versions, often leading to unintended results. Partly, a super-set Manifest.toml could solve it. However, a simple Pkg.up or similar operation could alter it. Did you say you pinned it? Instantiation and precompilation still lurk around. It is unreasonable to keep users waiting from using your highly performant, super-fast package.\r\n\r\nWith system images, one can start using packages quickly. However, you can't hand them over and expect them to work all the time. System images can sometimes fail to build; and often fail to relocate. Occasionally, they fail to start even on the same machine. We will walk through - how to interpret and fix these errors.\r\n\r\nWe need to deal with lots of releases of packages. One should ensure that the latest and greatest is delivered while maintaining consistency.\r\n\r\nWe want to talk about how to alleviate the issues in shipping with a mostly-contained and relocatable bundle that includes various components like a relocatable sysimage, additional packages for `stdlib` and a stackable depot with a pinned environment and more. These bundles should include all the artifacts necessary to run while not being bloated by them.\r\n\r\nDistributing private registries and packages is tricky. We will discuss how to enable it without giving away the source code.\r\n\r\nOur talk aims at decluttering the workflow of shipping packages by talking about how to set up one and the pitfalls; how to recognize and avoid them. It should give a better idea of how people can reliably build and share relocatable products to increase user adoption.",

  "description": "The abundance of gene flow in the Tree of Life challenges the notion that evolution can be represented with a fully bifurcating process, as this process cannot capture important biological realities like hybridization, introgression, or horizontal gene transfer. Coalescent-based network methods are increasingly popular, yet not scalable for big data, because they need to perform a heuristic search in the space of networks as well as numerical optimization that can be NP-hard. Here, we introduce a novel method to reconstruct phylogenetic networks based on algebraic invariants. While there is a long tradition of using algebraic invariants in phylogenetics, our work is the first to define phylogenetic invariants on concordance factors (frequencies of 4-taxon splits in the input gene trees) to identify level-1 phylogenetic networks under the multispecies coalescent model. Our novel inference methodology is optimization-free as it only requires evaluation of polynomial equations, and as such, it bypasses the traversal of network space yielding a computational speed at least 10 times faster than the fastest-to-date network methods. We illustrate the accuracy and speed of our new method on a variety of simulated scenarios as well as in the estimation of a phylogenetic network for the genus Canis. We implement our novel theory on an open-source publicly available Julia package phylo-diamond.jl with broad applicability within the evolutionary biology community.",

It is in nature, music, sports, economics, engineering, and so on. In our daily life, we use mathematics knowingly and unknowingly. Many of us are unaware that forensic experts use mathematics to solve crime mysteries. In this talk, we will explore how Sherlock Holmes, the famous fictional detective character created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle uses Mathematics and Julia programming language to solve crime mysteries. We will solve simple crime puzzles using mathematics and Julia scripts. Finally, we will solve a few complex hypothetical crime mysteries using advanced Julia concepts. The participants will learn how to use the concepts of mathematics such as statistics, probability, trigonometry, and graph theory, and Julia and its packages such as Measurements.jl, Plots.jl, Graphs.jl, DataFrames.jl, RecursiveArrayTools.jl, and MatrixNetworks.jl to solve the crime puzzles.\r\n\r\nOutline\r\n1.

  "description": "Best practices had to be developed to make the most of a new language in the development of Earth system models. Newer concepts in research software engineering find their way into the Earth system modelling community, particularly through the adoption of new languages. And the user demand on interfaces and interoperability to these models also has changed. \r\n\r\nWith custom types a domain specific language is created within our models and abstraction minimizes code redundancy. Ideally we would like to execute the same code on all computing architectures at high performance, but what are the best practices to achieve that? Earth system models are large with many interoperating parts. How can we build them with a flexibility that any user can swap in and out parts without diving deep into the code base? And we are aiming towards differentiable models that learn from data, ideally without sacrificing anything from above. This minisymposium aims to cover the following topics, but is not limited to\r\n\r\n- Abstraction, multiple dispatch, types and type hierarchies in large projects\r\n- Flexibility with respect to the computing architecture: CPUs, GPUs, and others\r\n- Modularity: easily extendible models and their components\r\n- Differentiability and optimization: Learning from data\r\n- Integration of Julia’s machine learning frameworks into models\r\n- Performance: Achieving and monitoring performance during development\r\n- Usage of high-performance and parallelism frameworks\r\n- Interconnectivity of packages across the Julia ecosystem\r\n- Bad practices: Julia’s detours, unnecessary complexity, or missing features\r\n\r\nPotential projects to be presented:\r\n\r\n- ClimaAtmos.jl and other projects in the CliMA framework\r\n- Oceananigans.jl\r\n- SpeedyWeather.jl\r\n- dJUICE.jl\r\n- ClimateModels.jl\r\n- ClimateTools.jl\r\n- NCDatasets.jl\r\n- DiskArrays.jl\r\n\r\nChair: Milan Klöwer (MIT);\r\nCo-chairs: Simon Byrne (Caltech), Chris Hill (MIT)",

We show how [TensorKit.jl](https://github.com/Jutho/TensorKit.jl) provides a way to develop symmetry-independent algorithms, which are still able to leverage the advantages given by the additional structure.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the practicality of these advancements, we briefly showcase the capabilities of [MPSKit.jl](https://github.com/maartenvd/MPSKit.jl), a matrix product state library that incorporates these symmetries.

  "description": "In their recent volume of “Econometrics with Machine Learning”, Chan & Mátyás (2022) remind us of the well-established distinction in which Econometrics and Machine Learning are perceived as alternative methodological cultures: one focused on prediction (model selection, sampling properties, accuracy metrics) and the other on explanation (causal inference, hypothesis testing, coefficient robustness). Moving away from this false dichotomy, we introduce ParallelGSReg (https://github.com/ParallelGSReg): a Julia’s research project with several packages (GlobalSearchRegression.jl, GlobalSearchRegressionGUI.jl and ModelSelection.jl) aimed at 1) building bridges between those complementary cultures; and 2) encouraging economic researchers to use Julia in order to improve computational efficiency in model selection tasks (particularly those using dimensionality reduction techniques with causal-inference requirements).\r\nIn JuliaCon 2018, the focus was on “efficiency”. We presented the world-fastest all-subset-regression command (GlobalSearchRegression.jl, which runs up to 3165 times faster than the original Stata-code and up to 197 times faster than well-known R-alternatives; see https://github.com/ParallelGSReg/JuliaCon2019/blob/master/GlobalSearchRegression.jl-paper.pdf). \r\nIn 2019, the goal was “ease of use” for what we improved our Graphic-User-Interface (GlobalSearchRegressionGUI.jl) and developed a basic package (ModelSelection.jl) to automatize Julia-to-Latex migration of dimensionality reduction results (which also includes all GlobalSearchRegression.jl functions and additional features like regularization and cross-fold validation).\r\nFor JuliaCon 2023 the target is “scope and integration”, for which we are: \r\n1) updating all packages (removing compatibility issues with the newest Julia versions); \r\n2) improving ModelSelection.jl with: \t\r\n2.a) new classification algorithms (logistic, probit, etc) for regularization and all-subset-regression functions; \r\n2.b) additional tests for causal inference (unit root tests);\r\n2.c) extended cross-fold validation capabilities (to deal with re-sampling requirements of panel data and time-series databases); and\r\n2.d) higher computational efficiency, reducing the Time-to-First-Result (TTFR) by focusing on statistical functions (moving Julia-to-Latex migration capabilities to a complementary package).\r\n3) developing ResearchAccelerator.jl, a new package with:\r\n3.a) extended Julia-to-Latex migration functions that work as an “automatic research assistant”. Using ModelSelection.jl results, it generates a Latex document, with relevant tables, graphics, and metrics.\r\n3.b) AI integration for references and literature review. Using user-provided keywords or phrases, ResearchAccelerator.jl will interact with Google Scholar to obtain a potentially relevant bibliography. Then a subset of them with available abstracts, references, and keywords will be used to provide citation networks, and keywords/ citations statistics. Finally, a machine learning system with modern NLP models will be used to generate, based on articles’ abstracts, a similarity network to provide users with additional information for a deeper search among related bibliography. This network will be exported to the Latex document as a table, a figure, and to a standard output file to be viewed using graph plotting and analysis tools such as Gephi.\r\n4) including a JuliaCall for Stata-integration, which allows all packages in our ParallelGSReg project to be used in batch mode through the Stata’s gsreg.ado package. This feature is developed to give change-averse economic researchers the simplest way to verify the substantial runtime reduction they can obtain by progressively switching to Julia.\r\nWe will introduce all these contributions (including some new benchmark figures) in the first 5 minutes of our Lightning talk. Then, a live hands-on example will be developed in 3 minutes to leave the last 2 minutes for audience questions.",

  "description": "Best practices had to be developed to make the most of a new language in the development of Earth system models. Newer concepts in research software engineering find their way into the Earth system modelling community, particularly through the adoption of new languages. And the user demand on interfaces and interoperability to these models also has changed. \r\n\r\nWith custom types a domain specific language is created within our models and abstraction minimizes code redundancy. Ideally we would like to execute the same code on all computing architectures at high performance, but what are the best practices to achieve that? Earth system models are large with many interoperating parts. How can we build them with a flexibility that any user can swap in and out parts without diving deep into the code base? And we are aiming towards differentiable models that learn from data, ideally without sacrificing anything from above. This minisymposium aims to cover the following topics, but is not limited to\r\n\r\n- Abstraction, multiple dispatch, types and type hierarchies in large projects\r\n- Flexibility with respect to the computing architecture: CPUs, GPUs, and others\r\n- Modularity: easily extendible models and their components\r\n- Differentiability and optimization: Learning from data\r\n- Integration of Julia’s machine learning frameworks into models\r\n- Performance: Achieving and monitoring performance during development\r\n- Usage of high-performance and parallelism frameworks\r\n- Interconnectivity of packages across the Julia ecosystem\r\n- Bad practices: Julia’s detours, unnecessary complexity, or missing features\r\n\r\nSchedule, Part 1\r\n\r\n- 14:00 Intro\r\n- 14:10 Gregory Wagner (MIT) on ocean modelling with Oceananigans.jl\r\n- 14:30 Skylar Gering (Caltech) on \"Discrete Element Sea-Ice Modeling in Julia: Successes and Challenges\"\r\n- 14:50 Milan Klöwer (MIT) on atmospheric modelling with SpeedyWeather.jl\r\n- 15:10 Julia Sloan/Lenka Novak (Caltech) on \"ClimaCoupler.jl: An Extensible ESM Coupler in Julia\"\r\n\r\n15:30-15:40 Break\r\n\r\nSchedule, Part 2\r\n\r\n- 15:40 Sarah Williamson (UT Austin) on \"Differentiable Ocean models with Enzyme.jl\"\r\n- 16:00 Lisa Rennels (UC Berkeley) on integrated assessment modelling with Mimi.jl\r\n- 16:20 Gaël Forget (MIT) on Julia-Fortran interfaces with ClimateModels.jl\r\n- 16:40 Overflow discussion time\r\n- 16:50 Outro\r\n\r\nChairs: Milan Klöwer (MIT), Simon Byrne (Caltech), Chris Hill (MIT)",

  "description": "A central objective in quantum spin models is to understand the physical behaviour of the system across the parameter domain of the associated Hamiltonian. Mathematically one wishes to compute the eigenfunction corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue (the ground state) at each parameter instance. Since the Hilbert space dimension (thus the size of the Hamiltonian) scales exponentially with the size of the physical system, each ground state computation is associated with a considerable cost. In contrast to an exhaustive systematic scan over the parameter domain, [ReducedBasis.jl](https://github.com/mfherbst/ReducedBasis.jl) follows a recent approach based on the reduced basis method (RBM) [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.105.045303). In this approach, a surrogate model is assembled by projecting the full problem onto a basis consisting of only a few tens of parameter snapshots, the only instances where the ground state needs to be computed. These snapshots are selected following a greedy strategy, which aims to maximally reduce the estimated error with each additional snapshot. Once the RBM surrogate has been assembled physical observables (e.g. for mapping out phase diagrams) can be computed for any parameter value with a modest complexity, notably scaling independently from the dimension of the Hilbert space.\r\n\r\nEven though the motivating applications for ReducedBasis.jl are quantum spin systems, the package is intended to be generally applicable to parametrised eigenvalue problems with a low-dimensional parameter space. Key steps of the RBM procedure can therefore be easily customised. Most importantly this concerns details on the \"ground truth\" method used for obtaining the eigenstates at the selected snapshots: Currently both broadly applicable standard iterative diagonalisation methods such as LOBPCG as well as specialised tensor network methods such as the density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) approach are supported. Both modes of operation will be illustrated in our talk, where we apply ReducedBasis.jl to both a simple parametrised eigenproblem, a chain of Rydberg atoms as well as to one-dimensional quantum spin-1 models featuring rich quantum phase diagrams. Compared to a traditional approach using only DMRG and ITensors.jl we demonstrate a manyfold speedup when DMRG calculations are complemented by ReducedBasis.jl. \r\n\r\nThis is joint work with Matteo Rizzi (Universität Köln), Benjamin Stamm (Universität Stuttgart) and Stefan Wessel (RWTH Aachen).\r\n\r\n[1] [M.

  "description": "We present, a modular framework for energy systems analyses. A specific goal of the development is to address the challenges of analyzing multi energy-carrier systems with sector coupling, bringing together modelling of technologies that are traditionally modelled separately, with a large span in the need for temporal and geographic resolution, and where accurate models are often non-linear and come with high computational cost.\r\nThe model is based on existing (proprietary) models and planned to be an open-source framework. It will serve as basis for new extensions in the future and is designed to be modular and flexible to facilitate modelling at different resolutions and technological detail, leveraging Julia’s multiple dispatch. \r\n#### Time representation - TimeStruct.jl\r\nRepresentation of time is provided by a first package, TimeStruct.jl, which abstracts the representation of time by providing time-related types and methods, thereby separating the technology description from the time structure. TimeStruct.jl makes it simple to change time resolution and provides types for efficient representation of time series for different time structures, including multi-level structures which are common for optimization models for investment analyses, allowing investments only in a subset of time periods. Iterations over the time periods is achieved through the introduction of iterators and the application of multiple dispatch. TimeStruct.jl also includes the implementation of both operational and strategic uncertainty allowing for the implementation of stochastic problems.\r\n#### The base package - EnergyModelsBase.jl\r\nThe core of the energy model is a base package that provides the fundamental building blocks for energy systems such as production, conversion, and consumption of energy by different processes, implemented using JuMP. The base package focuses on operational models and can be easily extended by other packages to add new functionality (e.g., support for investments/capacity expansion or geography), or to add more precise technology descriptions, e.g., using mixed integer or non-linear production functions or constraints through the application of multiple dispatch on both the model type and the technology nodes. The implementation of improved descriptions does not require any modifications to the base package due the applications of Julia's multiple dispatch. This modularity simplifies future development of, e.g., improved technology descriptions due to the separation between technology and framework descriptions. In addition, it allows for fast development of required technology descriptions.\r\n#### Example extension - EnergyModelsInvestment.jl\r\nWhile many larger optimization models in practice only provide users with a limited set of options for investments (e.g., discrete or continuous), InvestmentModels.jl provides types for different classes of investments that can be used in different combinations, e.g., discrete, continuous, or semi-continuous, and provides extra functionality in dependencies between projects (e.g., not allow investing in project A until project B is in operation). The modelling of investment options is separated from the modelling of technology and time structure, allowing easy customization to different use cases. The use of custom types and multiple dispatch also facilitates more efficient model creation, by only generating the necessary (binary) variables for the chosen investment options.",

The size, shape, and structure of these\r\ndatasets (and the associated learning tasks) require some modifications of a\r\ntypical machine learning workflow (e.g. one in which the entire dataset is\r\nprocessed in its entirety in each training epoch).\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will present\r\n[OndaBatches.jl](https://github.com/beacon-biosignals/OndaBatches.jl), a Julia\r\npackage that implements a set of patterns that have proven to be useful across a\r\nnumber of projects at Beacon.  OndaBatches.jl serves as a foundation for\r\nbuilding the specific batch randomization, featurization, and data movement\r\nsystems that each machine learning project requires.  Its purpose is to build\r\nand serve batches for machine learning workflows based on densely labeled time\r\nseries data, in a way that is:\r\n- distributed (cloud native, throw more resources at it to make sure data\r\n  movement is not the bottleneck)\r\n- scalable (handle out-of-core datasets, both for signal data and labels)\r\n- deterministic + reproducible (pseudo-random)\r\n- resumable\r\n- flexible and extensible via normal Julia mechanisms of multiple dispatch\r\n\r\nThis talk focuses on two aspects of OndaBatches.jl design and development.\r\nFirst, I'll describe the process of moving a local workflow into a distributed\r\nsetting in order to support scalability.  Second, I'll discuss how Julia's\r\ncomposability has shaped the design and functionality of OndaBatches.jl.  In\r\nparticular, OndaBatches.jl builds on...\r\n- ...[Onda.jl](https://github.com/beacon-biosignals/Onda.jl) to represent both\r\n  the multi-channel time series that is the input data and the regularly-sampled\r\n  labels.\r\n- ...[Distributed.jl](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Distributed/) to\r\n  compose well with various cluster managers (including Kubernetes via\r\n  [K8sClusterManagers.jl](https://github.com/beacon-biosignals/K8sClusterManagers.jl/))\r\n  in service of scalability.\r\n- ...base Julia patterns around iteration in order to separate batch\r\n  _state_ from batch _content_ (in service of reproducibility and resumability)\r\n- ...Julia's multiple dispatch pattern to allow our machine learning\r\n  teams to customize behavior where needed without having to re-invent basic\r\n  functionality every time.",

  "description": "Fast-paced product development environments in industry can leverage Julia in their software stack to increase the pace of development and testing of cyber-physical systems. The flexibility and ease-of-use provided by a dynamically typed language, combined with the runtime speed made possible by pre-compiling, allows Julia to be used in place of C++ for the purpose of simulating large, complex systems that interface with embedded hardware and software in real-time. This talk will focus on a real-world aerospace application and survey the practices used to make this possible while suggesting capabilities for future development that would improve performance and usability. The specific techniques and features discussed include 1) running the Julia-based simulation models through a pre-compile step, 2) tracking and minimizing memory allocations to avoid garbage collection such that real-time integration with embedded hardware is possible, and 3) interfacing with C++ shared libraries that connect the Julia simulation models with the embedded hardware and software. Specific examples of applications to hardware-in-the-loop testing environments for aerospace systems will be presented. Further, we will note efforts to compile and run Julia code on an embedded system and why those efforts were abandoned.",

  "description": "Visualization of mixed-effects models often focuses on the same plots as classical regression models: visualization is focused on effects plots and diagnostic plots that largely ignore the complexity and subtlety introduced by random effects.\r\nMixedModelsMakie.jl provides a shrinkage plot, which displays the change from classical OLS estimates to the conditional modes (random effects) for the block-level predictions.\r\nIn addition to demonstrating the concept of shrinkage, these displays also provide informative diagnostic information on random-effects structure. \r\nFor example, models with a degenerate random-effects structure, i.e. singular models, generally show the excess dimensionality quite clearly in shrinkage plots.\r\nShrinkage plots also provide a convenient way to visualize the tradeoffs of a restricted covariance structure: fewer parameters to optimize, but less efficient shrinkage.\r\n\r\nMixedModels.jl also allows tracing of the optimization procedure, i.e. exploration of the parameter space.\r\nWe can take advantage of this trace to visualize and better understand the behavior of the optimizer and the challenges involved in fitting large or complex models.\r\nFor example, we can observe that optimization generally follows three phases: an initial phase of broad exploration of the parameter space, a phase rapid convergence to the neighborhood of the optimum and a final phase of fine tuning of parameter estimates and verification. \r\nIn large models, the final phase tends to dominate, which has implications for a speed-accuracy tradeoff in certain applications.\r\n\r\nFinally, we can also examine animation of shrinkage across the course of optimization.\r\nThe change in shrinkage is relevant as a practical implication for speed-accuracy tradeoffs in model fits and also serves to highlight how shrinkage -- like all regularization -- is an example of the bias-variance tradeoff.\r\nFor mixed models, this means a tradeoff between the observation-level variance and the between-group variance.",

  "description": "We introduce GeNIOS.jl, a Julia language alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based convex optimization. We built this solver with an eye towards large-scale data-driven problems, such as those that that come up in robust optimization and machine learning. However, the solver can tackle any convex optimization problem that can be tractably solved with ADMM.\r\n\r\nWe first detail the algorithm. This solver builds on a line of work in randomized numerical linear algebra and inexact ADMM, i.e., ADMM in which the subproblems are only solved approximately. In GeNIOS.jl, we use a quadratic approximation to the smooth subproblem, an idea explored for the unconstrained case in [1]. We then leverage the Nystrom Sketch to dramatically speedup the linear system solve [2] in this subproblem. When this subproblem comprises most of the computational effort, as is frequently the case in practice, our use of approximation and randomization yields significant speedups.\r\n\r\nWe will then introduce the package’s interface. We provide a `standard library’ which makes it easy to solve a number of problems, including logistic regression and quadratic programs. We will demonstrate how to define custom problems as well and show examples coming from different application areas. Finally, we will showcase the performance improvement of GeNIOS.jl compared to other methods.\r\n\r\nThis work builds on ideas presented at JuMP-dev last year, extending the class of problems tackled from quadratic programs to all convex optimization problems. We will conclude with more future directions and promising applications of these ideas and this solver.\r\n\r\n[1] Zhao, S., Frangella, Z., & Udell, M. (2022).

  "description": "The community of Julia users in academic fields involving quantum phenomena and in the quantum computing industry continues to grow. There is already a vibrant ecosystem of quantum-related Julia packages and users and developers at a variety of career stages: high school, undergraduate, and graduate students; postdoctoral scholars; faculty; staff scientists; and industry researchers and developers. In these conjoined minisymposia, the community would be able to present their work to a quantum-focused audience, allowing package developers to present material more relevant to an expert audience (which is often not really appropriate for the wider JuliaCon audience), more junior community members to find mentors in their area, and allowing community members working in different areas to find areas of common interest or need.\r\n\r\nFor example, the minisymposium might contain a talk about tensor network methods in condensed matter physics, and another talk about these methods as applied to quantum circuit simulation, allowing developers in both areas to understand where current Julia implementations are lacking and find new contributors. Having a dedicated stream (minisymposia) for this kind of talk would facilitate this kind of interaction.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a quantum-focused series of minisymposia would allow the \"quantum curious\" -- students, those in industry but without a background in the relevant fields -- to see the \"lay of the land\" and find opportunities to contribute, for research, or for job searches.\r\n\r\nWe propose a double or conjoined minisymposium -- one session in the morning, one in the afternoon -- because of the breadth of the community and the wide variety of use cases and fields of study covered. Two sessions will allow us to include enough full length talks to treat each area fairly, as even with much background in common, a full length talk is often needed to treat a topic in the \"quantum\" area in sufficient depth. We also hope to solicit lightning talks from more junior members (e.g. graduate or undergraduate students).\r\n\r\nConfirmed speakers:\r\n\r\n    Matt Fishman & Miles Stoudenmire (ITensor.jl)\r\n    Katharine Hyatt (Amazon Braket)\r\n    QuEra computing",

  "description": "Hydro-Quebec is the main public electricity utility for the province of Quebec. Its demand forecast team has been working for decades with Fortran coded models. Julia was selected as the replacement for Fortran. Since those models are used daily in a critical system and history vouches for their reliability, great care will be taken to ensure the quality of the Julia replacements. The first step undertaken in this transition is to replace one of the optimisation libraries, ENLSIP, written in the 80’s. This is a least square error minimisation library for non-linear equations with non-linear constraints. Conversion and upgrade of that library is in the process but before improving the optimisation process, current efforts are made to ensure that the Julia version reproduces the original Fortran version. To that effect, Julia-Fortran interface is used to create a Julia application that allows to compare both versions of the library in context of the calling applications, still in Fortran. The talk will describe the intertwining of Fortran and Julia as the optimisation library is provided with call back functions to calculate the errors and derivates. In a nutshell, Julia calls Fortran that calls Julia which calls Fortran. This approach isolated the Julia version of the library which can be called by a Julia application devoid of Fortran code as the callback subroutines were wrapped in Julia. An example stripped of the proprietary code illustrating the handling of data and functions will be made public. We will also cover in the talk the tests methodology and graphical tools used to analyze the search space.",

  "description": "Component-based acausal modeling is a system for quickly generating large-scale, efficient models by composing elements with known physics. All that one has to do is to define components that represent objects, such as transistors, air conditioning units, or pipes, and connect them to generate accurate physical models of real-world phenomena. However, these models can  easily require hundreds of components. How can one avoid the tedious task of having to understand and write the physics of so many things? \r\n\r\nThe answer is ModelingToolkit’s system for component-based modeling. With ModelingToolkit, you can compose components and it will generate the resulting set of equations as simulatable differential equations amenable to simulation with the DifferentialEquations.jl environment.  To aid in the use of modeling standard systems, we introduce a new component to the ModelingToolkit and SciML ecosystem called the ModelingToolkitStandardLibrary.  The ModelingToolkitStandardLibrary is a standard library of pre-built components modeled with ModelingToolkit. We want this package to serve two purposes; as a starting place for anyone who wants to get started with modeling, and as a performant dependency for power users. \r\n\r\nMTKStdLib is structured to provide extendable basic blocks. This talk intends to walk users through the process of composing custom models using these components. We will speak about the internal structure, best practices, and known gotchas.\r\nWe will briefly talk about all the signals and shapes we support, the utility and math blocks we provide; the thermal ports, thermal circuit components like convective and thermal- resistors, and inductors, `HeatCapacitors`; the magnetic component: `FluxTubes`; the rotational library; and the electrical circuit components.\r\n \r\nThis talk should leave users supercharged to use MTK and the standard library to model the world and beyond.",

  "description": "Decision Programming combines ideas from the fields of decision analysis and stochastic programming, using the strengths of both approaches to overcome the limitations of the other. Stochastic optimization has struggled with representing endogenous uncertainties, which can be easily represented in an influence diagram. On the other hand, solution methods for influence diagrams are often problem-specific and require strong assumptions, such as the no-forgetting assumption. Using the solution methods available for mixed-integer linear problems helps us overcome these challenges.\r\n\r\nWhile Decision Programming is still in a relatively early development phase as a mathematical optimization framework, we have published the package DecisionProgramming.jl, implementing the framework in its current state. We believe that Decision Programming can be a valuable tool for users in the field of mathematical optimization and decision-making. A significant amount of work has gone into making the framework user-friendly, making it easy for an inexperienced user to formulate decision problems and obtain solutions without strong knowledge of the underlying optimization methods. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the core framework, we present examples of primal heuristics and valid inequalities for improving the computational performance of the framework considerably. DecisionProgramming.jl is built as an extension to JuMP, allowing more experienced users to easily modify and further extend the formulations in the package. This combination of being easy to use for beginners and easy to build on for experienced users is what has strongly contributed to the popularity of JuMP, and we hope this will also be the case for DecisionProgramming.jl.",

  "description": "Financial markets are composed of complex and evolving interactions that are difficult to define. Systems that exhibit these dynamics are known as *complex adaptive systems* (CAS). In these systems, the micro-scale behaviors of individual actors or agents (e.g., retail investors, trading firms, etc.) coalesce to generate *emergent properties* at the macro-scale. In financial systems, emergent properties can manifest unexpectedly and have varying consequences. One example of emergence is the price discovery process, in which the price series of an asset is determined through the individual orders submitted by various buyers and sellers. Other emergent phenomena can be irrational and deviate significantly from historical events, such as a *flash crash* (i.e., a sudden and extreme drop in asset value that can have lingering and widespread effects on the market).\r\n\r\nAgent-based models (ABMs) capture critical features of complex systems—emergent properties, non-linearity, and heterogeneity. These features arise naturally due to the micro-scale interactions; that is, macroscopic properties of the system emerge without being explicitly constrained, or under any assumption, to do so. ABMs typically undergo both a calibration and validation procedure to generate realistic behavior. This entire process is facilitated by a combination of two new packages: Brokerage.jl and TradingAgents.jl.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we calibrate an agent-based model of risky asset price dynamics and trading behavior by configuring agent-specific parameters through heuristics and machine learning (online recursive least squares). To validate the model, we run statistical tests on the simulation outputs and compare these against actual market behavior (i.e., check for the presence of empirical regularities, or “stylized facts”, through the use of empirical macroscopic data). We’ll show that our market ABM produces price and volume time series with many statistical features of actual market data, e.g., non-Gaussian returns distributions and volatility clustering. Further, we’ll demonstrate our market ABM’s ability to function across multiple assets and large agent population sizes. Taken together, this new package ecosystem presents an opportunity for researchers to model and analyze complex market phenomena in a flexible, scalable, and fully open-source environment.",

In order to keep the complexity of expressing the model separate from that of working with it, we have designed and implemented a modelling language that supports the necessary features.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we would like to share with our audience how we designed and implemented the domain-specific language for StateSpaceEcon.jl and what we learned along the way. With concrete and practical examples, we will explain the motivations behind our design decisions and demonstrate a few key techniques we employed in our implementations. Specifically, we plan to cover the following aspects.\r\n1.\tHow the model developer can declare the various properties of the model, namely variables, shocks, parameters and equations.\r\n2.\tExplain why we encapsulate each model into its own Julia module.\r\n3.\tHow we manipulate model equations to automatically compute the dynamic and steady state residuals and their derivatives.\r\n4.\tHow we implement the ability to express time series operations in the model equations, such as moving averages, and how we allow for user-defined extensions.\r\n5.\tHow we deal with parameters that are functions of other parameters.\r\n\r\nIf time permits, we can also discuss the following.\r\n6.\tHow we allow additional constraints for the steady state system of the model.\r\n7.\tHow we assemble the residual functions into a stacked-time global system and how we construct its sparse Jacobian matrix.\r\n8.\tHow we linearize individual equations or the entire system.\r\n9.\tOur discrete time series type descendent from AbstractVector, together with its primitive frequency type.",

  "description": "Bruno.jl provides four main types of tools for working with financial derivatives: a descriptive type system, time-series data simulating, derivative asset pricing tools, and trading strategy simulating environment. The package takes advantage of multiple dispatch and parametric types to allow for more possibilities for financial analysis.  \r\n\r\nMultiple dispatch allows for more flexibility and extensions of the code. For example, Bruno can calculate theoretical historical derivatives prices for a variety of pricing models such as the Black-Scholes model and Monte Carlo analysis, by simply switching the input types. With few lines of code, theoretical prices can be calculated for many financial derivatives at different points in time. It is important to note that long-term derivative prices and exotic option prices may not be readily accessible without incurring a cost. Thus, many trading and hedging strategies, by necessity are currently based on asset prices. Bruno.jl will allow them to be based on theoretical derivative prices instead.   \r\n\r\nThe modular architecture of Bruno.jl lets finance professionals use the different parts of the package interchangeably, leading to many novel combinations of tools. For example, a key feature of Bruno.jl is that it can produce a distribution of maximum loss that could result from a trading or hedging strategy. These distributions can be estimated with several different time-series simulating processes or derivative pricing models. This information would be valuable to financial practitioners, hedge funds, and market makers as it would help to quantity the risk of a potential strategy before putting the strategy into place. Therefore, Bruno.jl allows for better comparison of different trading and hedging strategies under different assumed market conditions. \r\n\r\nBruno was designed to be used by academic researchers as well as finance practitioners such as derivatives analysts, hedge fund managers, or market makers. It allows for complete analysis of financial assets and strategies in a single package.",

MathOpt is part of Google's open source project OR-Tools and is used extensively within Google. MathOpt consists of three parts: (1) client libraries in various programming languages (including C++, Java and Python) to formulate a model, independently of any underlying solver, (2) an efficient, language independent data format for models, model updates and solutions, and (3) a core library to solve models in this data format with existing commercial and open source optimization solvers (e.g. Gurobi, GLOP). MathOpt provides solver independent support for a range of advanced features, including nonlinear constraints, duality, rays, LP basis, callbacks, and solver parameters. The core library of MathOpt (and the C++ client) are written in portable C++ and can run on servers, mobile devices, or even in the browser via WASM. MathOpt supports remote execution for all features (including callbacks) via RPC. For non-C++ languages, each client library is written entirely in that language, so users relying on remote solve do not require any native dependency to install and run MathOpt. We provide benchmarks showing that the overhead introduced by MathOpt is in most cases negligible.",

  "description": "**Introduction**\r\n\r\nComplex networks can change over time as vertices and edges get added or removed. Modelling the temporal evolution of networks and predicting their structure is an open challenge across a wide variety of disciplines: from the study of ecological networks as food-webs, to predictions about the structure of economical networks; from the analysis of Social Networks, to the modelling of how our brain develops and adapts during our lives.\r\n\r\nIn their usual representation, networks are binary (an edge is either observed or not), sparse (each vertex is linked to a very small subset of the network), large (up to billions of nodes), and changes are discrete rewiring events. These properties make them hard to handle with classic machine learning techniques and have barred the use of some mathematical modelling frameworks such as differential equations. In this talk, we show how we used Julia, and in particular the Scientific Machine learning (SciML) framework, to model the temporal evolution of complex networks as continuous, multivariate, dynamical systems from observational data. We took an approach cutting across different mathematical disciplines (machine learning, differential equations, and graph theory): this was possible largely thanks to the integration of packages like Graph.jl (and the integrated MetaGraph.jl package) with the SciML ecosystem, e.g., DiffEqFlux.jl, via graph embeddings in metric spaces.\r\n\r\nFor this latter task, we will present a novel Julia package called [DotProductGraphs.jl](https://www.github.com/gvdr/DotProductGraphs.jl) to easily and efficiently compute graph embedding, building on interpreting networks as Random Dot Product Graphs (RDPG).\r\n\r\n**Methodology**\r\n\r\n1. To translate the discrete, high-dimensional, dynamical system into a continuous, low-dimensional one, we rely on a network embedding technique. A network embedding maps the vertices of a network to points in a (low-dimensional) metric space. We adopt the well-studied Random Dot-Product Graphs statistical model: the mapping is provided by a truncated Singular Value Decomposition of the network’s adjacency matrix; to reconstruct the network we use the fact that the probability of interaction between two vertices is given by the dot product of the points they map to. The decomposition of the adjacency matrices and their alignment is a computationally intensive  step, and we tackle it thanks to the fast matrix algorithms available for Julia implemented in our novel DotProductGraphs.jl package.\r\n\r\n2. In the embedding framework, a discrete change in the network is modelled as the effect of a continuous displacement of the points in the metric space. Our goal then, is that of discovering from the data (the network observed at various points in time) an adequate dynamical system capturing the laws governing the temporal evolution of the complex network. This is possible thanks to a pipeline that combines Neural or Universal ODEs and the identification of nonlinear dynamical systems, e.g. SiNDY.\r\n\r\nIn general, each node may influence the temporal evolution of every over node in the network, and, if we are working in a space with dimension d, and N nodes, this translates to a dynamical system with N*N*d variables. As networks may often have thousands or millions of nodes, that number can be huge. In our talk we are going to discuss various strategies we adopted to tame the complexity of the dynamical system.\r\n\r\n**Future Development**\r\n\r\nWe are now working on three fronts:\r\n- we are scaling up the framework, so to model larger networks (for example to model social networks, where being able to predict what people might link with others in the future could be a tool to fight the growing problem of misinformation and disinformation);\r\n- we are progressively moving from Neural Differential Equations to Universal Differential Equations, both to capture any preexisting knowledge of the network dynamical system, and to help with the training complexity;\r\n- we are exploring data augmentation techniques to interpolate between the estimated embeddings, other embeddings, and other neural network architectures.\r\n\r\nThese three development directions constitute interesting challenges for the Julia practitioner interested in extending Julia modeling abilities. We will discuss them in the talk and suggest how everyone can contribute\r\n\r\nAll the code will be made available in a dedicated git repository and we are preparing a detailed publication to illustrate our approach.",

  "description": "**Background**: Bayesian inference realizes optimal information processing through a full commitment to reasoning by probability theory. The Bayesian framework is positioned at the core of modern AI technology for applications such as speech and image recognition and generation, medical analysis, robot navigation, etc., as it describes how a rational agent ought to update beliefs when new information is revealed by the agent's environment. Unfortunately, perfect Bayesian reasoning is generally intractable, since it requires the calculation of (often) very high-dimensional integrals. As a result, a number of numerical algorithms for approximating Bayesian inference have been developed and implemented in probabilistic programming packages. Successful methods include variants of Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, Variational Inference (VI), and Laplace approximation.   \r\n\r\n**Problem statement**: Many important AI applications, such as self-driving vehicles and extended reality video processing, require real-time Bayesian inference. However, sampling-based inference methods do not scale well to realistic probabilistic models with a significant number of latent states. As a result, Monte Carlo sampling-based methods are not suitable for real-time applications. Variational Inference promises to scale better than sampling-based inference, but VI requires derivation of gradients of a \"variational Free Energy\" cost function. For large models, manual derivation of these gradients is not feasible, and automated \"black-box\" gradient methods are too inefficient to be applicable to real-time inference applications. Therefore, while Bayesian inference is known as the optimal data processing framework, in practice, real-time AI applications rely on much simpler, often ad hoc, data processing algorithms. \r\n\r\n**Solution proposal**: We present RxInfer.jl, a package for processing infinite data streams by real-time Bayesian inference in large probabilistic models. RxInfer is open source, available at http://rxinfer.ml, and enjoys the following features:\r\n- A flexible probabilistic model specification. Through Julia macros, RxInfer is capable of automatically transforming a textual description of a probabilistic model to a factor graph representation of that model.\r\n- A flexible inference engine. The inference engine supports a variety of well-known message passing-based inference methods such as belief propagation, structured and mean-field variational message passing, expectation propagation, etc.\r\n- A customized trade-off between accuracy and speed. For each (node and edge) location in the graph, RxInfer enables a custom specification of inference constraints on the variational family of distributions. This enables the use of different Bayesian inference methods at different locations of the graph, leading to an optimized trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity.\r\n- Support for real-time processing of infinite data streams. Since RxInfer is based on a reactive programming framework, implemented by the package Rocket.jl, an ongoing inference process is always interruptible and an inference result is always available.  \r\n- Support for large static data sets. The package is not limited to real-time processing of data streams and also scales well to batch processing of large data sets.\r\n- RxInfer is extensible. A large and extendable collection of precomputed analytical inference solutions for standard problems increases the efficiency of the inference process. Current methods include solutions for linear Gaussian dynamical systems, auto-regressive Models, Gaussian and Gamma mixture models, convolution of distributions, and conjugate pair primitives. \r\n\r\n**Evaluation**: Over the past few years, the ecosystem has been tested on many advanced probabilistic models that have led to several publications in high-ranked journals such as Entropy [1], Frontiers [2], and conferences like MLSP[3], ISIT[4], PGM[5] and others.  A fast and user-friendly automatic Bayesian inference framework is a key factor to expand the applicability of Bayesian inference methods to real-time AI applications. More generally, access to fast Bayesian inference will benefit the wider statistical research community. We are excited to present our work on RxInfer and discuss its strengths and limitations.\r\n\r\n**References**: More at biaslab.github.io/publication/.\r\n\r\n[1] Message Passing and Local Constraint Manipulation in Factor Graphs, Entropy.

  "description": "One of the most promising evolutions in Machine Learning and AI is the approximation and analysis of differential equation systems with deep learning, i.e. Neural Network Differential Equations. Julia’s SciML ecosystem introduced an effective way to model natural phenomena as dynamical systems with Universal Differential Equations (UDE’s).The UDE framework enriches both classic and Neural Network differential equation modeling by combining an explicitly “known” term (which comes from our scientific knowledge of the natural phenomenon we are studying) with an “unknown” term (what rests to be discovered). Researchers are looking at how noise in the data observations, irregular observations, or inherent variability affect the performance of these techniques. This implicitly assumes that what we think about the natural phenomenon is correctly expressed in the known term. In this talk, instead, we are going to use Julia’s SciML ecosystem to study how an erroneous or partial understanding of a phenomenon (a perturbation of the known term) impacts our ability to discover the unknown component.\r\n\r\nWithin a UDE framework, the unknown terms, and therefore the overall functional forms of the dynamical system, are learned from the observational data by fitting a Neural Network. Methods such as sparse identification of non-linear dynamics (SINDy) can then be applied to simplify the fitted neural network and improve the performance of our model. We focus instead on the impact of possible pathologies in the design of a UDE system, and in particular, on possible errors we introduce in the expression of the known term. We pose the question, “what happens if our domain’s knowledge is incorrectly specified?”. In the context of the famous quote “It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you in trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so” attributed to Mark Twain, we explore the magnitude of the trouble you get into.\r\n\r\n### Mathematical Setting\r\nMore in detail, for a set of variables X, we consider a dynamical system of the form\r\n`dX/dt=F(X)=K(X)+U(X)`.\r\nIn the following, we consider `K(X)` as known (ie.g., from domain knowledge), and `U(X)` as the “unknown” component we wish to discover.\r\nWe sample observational data from `X(t)` at various points in time.\r\nLet `Kp(X)` be a perturbed version of K, that is, an erroneous specification of the domain knowledge. We try to recover `F(X)` from the data by optimizing a UDE of the form\r\n`dX/dt=Kp(X)+NN(X)`.\r\nFor example, choosing `K(x)=sin(x)` we sample data from the system  `dX/dt=sin(x)+exp(x)` and we try to recover it from a UDE such as `dX/dt=cos(x)+NN(X)`, where `Kp(x)=sin(x + π/2)` .\r\n\r\nIn this setting, we ask how strongly can we mispecify `K(X)` and still recover the functional form of `F(X)`?\r\n\r\nWe study the problem within the Julia’s SciML framework, exploiting its capacity of interoperating with symbolic computation systems, such as, Symbolics.jl and its high performance to explore a large space of original and perturbed functions.\r\n\r\n### Future Development\r\n\r\nThe preliminary results raise interesting questions about the presence of undetectable domain knowledge errorse.\r\n\r\nOur talk will interest both people who study UDEs for our cautionary and surprising results, and the wider audience interested more in the use of Julia in mathematical modeling for the encouraging examples of interoperability we present.\r\nThe talk will present how Julia helped us in this experimental mathematical exercise, and offer many opportunities for further investigations.\r\n\r\nThe presentation will be as light as possible on the mathematical side, present ample examples of how the interoperability of Julia helped our analysis, and assumes little or no prior knowledge of UDE’s. Graphs and examples will also be used to aid understanding of the topic.",

Our goal is to describe the emergent behavior of a cell in terms of basic chemical and mechanical interactions between individual proteins. By rewriting our object-oriented C++ implementation in Julia we were able to speed up simulations by over 10x. We changed the overall framework architecture and used various high-performance Julia packages, including Optim.jl, CellListMap.jl, and JumpProcesses.jl to achieve this speed up. I will describe our strategy for combining stochastic reaction diffusion with deformable membrane and filament mechanics. Lastly, I will show some of the current applications of our model to study neuron growth and the T-cell immune synapse in collaboration with various experimental groups.

  "description": "The development of new clean-generation technologies also leads to new plant-level architectures that combine several generation and storage assets behind the point of connection. These co-located generation resources (Hybrid Systems) primarily operate as merchant assets that employ automated market bidding models and internal Energy Management Systems (EMS) to comply with the operator's signals. Formulating an optimal bidding model requires embedding the EMS control model into the bidding algorithm, resulting in a bi-level optimization problem. In this presentation, we first showcase using JuMP to formulate and solve this problem effectively for multiple merchant systems and the bidding outcomes considering different model formulations. Second, the bidding outcomes are later integrated into a PowerSimulations.jl (also built with JuMP) simulation to study the system-level effects of the various merchant bidding and the interactions between market-clearing models and the embedded EMS model. We will showcase simulations conducted in the RTS system considering different levels of merchant hybrid systems participation. The presentation provides the following specific insights on JuMP usage: 1) the Formulation of specialized bi-level problems with custom cuts to solve the merchant hybrid system bidding problem, 2) the integration of a modular model within a complex simulation workflow supported by JuMP in PowerSimulations.jl 3) Accelerating the solution of power systems operations simulation that employ agent optimization problems using JuMP.",

The presentation will review a full Bayesian hierarchical PBPK modeling framework in Julia, using the open-source SciML ecosystem and Turing.jl, that can accurately infer the posterior distributions of the parameters of interest. Additionally, diagnostics will be reviewed to evaluate general goodness-of-fit and the model predictive performance. The framework displays the composability of Julia packages that can be synced together using a single model definition to run various analyses, which include Bayesian analysis, sensitivity analysis, as well as population simulations that can explore alternative dosing scenarios.

  "description": "I-INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nNumerical simulations are an important tool for analyzing and developing new acquisition and reconstruction methods in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Simulations allow us to isolate and study phenomena by removing unwanted effects, such as hardware imperfections, and others. Additionally, with the increasing use of Machine Learning models, simulation becomes even more relevant, because it can be used to generate synthetic data for training, or to construct signal dictionaries to infer quantitative measurements from the acquired data. Moreover, simulations are an excellent tool for education and training, as hands-on experience is a great way to assimilate the theoretical and practical components of MRI.\r\n\r\nWe believe an ideal simulator should be general, fast, easy to use, extensible, open-source, and cross-platform. In this work, we developed an MRI simulation framework built from the ground up to satisfy these requirements. We chose the Julia programming language because its syntax is similar to MATLAB (widely used by the MRI community), its excellent GPU support, and its speed is comparable to C/C++. This has been shown to be the case in other MRI applications such as image reconstruction with MRIReco.jl, where the authors achieved speeds on par with state-of-the-art toolboxes.\r\n\r\nWe called our simulator “Koma”, inspired by the Japanese word for spinning top, as its physics resemble MRI’s\r\n\r\nII-METHODS\r\n\r\nKoma simulates the magnetization the spins in a virtual object by solving the Bloch equations. The solution of these equations for a single spin is independent of the state of the other spins in the system, a key feature that enables parallelization. \r\n\r\nOur simulator uses a first-order splitting method to simplify the solution of the Bloch equations. This reflects mathematically the intuition of separating the Bloch equations in a two-step process, rotation and relaxation, for each time step. This method is exact in many common cases in MRI, but in general, has O(dt^3) convergence.\r\n\r\nFor CPU parallelization, we used the macro Threads.@threads, and the package ThreadsX.jl. To ensure thread safety, we stored the acquired signals per thread in different matrices to add them later into a signal matrix. On the other hand, for the GPU support we operated with CuArrays from CUDA.jl.\r\n\r\nWe ensured type stability to enable high performance. Moreover, we had special care to perform in-place operations and not generate unnecessary variable copies using the @view macro in the simulation functions. Finally, we used NVIDIA Nsight Systems to profile GPU performance with the NVTX.@range and CUDA.@profile macros.\r\n\r\nFor the GUI we used Blink.jl, a framework to develop applications using web technologies. The GUI allows the user to easily plot the sequence, 𝑘-space, phantom, acquired signal, and reconstructed images. Plots are done using the PlotlyJS.jl package, which also allows to export them to .svg files.\r\n\r\nTo test the accuracy of our simulator, we compared Koma with the latest version of JEMRIS (v2.9), which has been compared with real MRI acquisitions. On the other hand, we compared the speed of our simulations against MRiLab, an open-source GPU-accelerated MRI simulator. Finally, to compare the ease of use for first-time users, we designed a pilot experience with students of an Imaging course in Engineering, where they learned some fundamentals of MRI.\r\n\r\nIII-RESULTS\t\t\r\n\r\nFor the simulated scenarios we obtained accurate results with MAEs below 0.1% when compared to JEMRIS. When we tested the simulation speed against MRiLab, we found that we had slower CPU performance, but we were 2.6 times faster for the GTX 1650Ti and 6.0 times for the RTX 2080 Ti. \r\n\r\nWe think the CPU results show that we still perform unwanted synchronizations between threads, a problem that our GPU implementation would not suffer as we use Nthreads=1 by default.\r\n\r\nIn the students experience, they reported no problem installing Julia (mean 4.7/5), Koma (mean 4.2/5), JEMRIS (3.8/5), and MRiLab (4.3/5). Regarding the time taken to install each simulator, most of the students were able to install Koma (mean 13.2 min), JEMRIS (mean 33.8 min), and MRiLab (mean 16.9 min) in less than 40 minutes.\r\n\r\nTheir first simulation took them more time in JEMRIS (mean 19 min) and MRiLab (mean 13.9 min) than in Koma (mean 5.7 min). 31% of the students could not simulate on MRiLab (6 students using Mac OS), so we only used Koma and JEMRIS for the rest of the activities.\r\n\r\nTheir reported median simulation speeds were 8.4 times faster with Koma than with JEMRIS, and 65% recommended Koma over JEMRIS.\r\n\r\nIV-CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nIn this work, we presented a new general MRI simulator programmed in Julia. This simulator is fast, easy to use, extensible, open-source, and cross-platform. These characteristics were achieved by choosing the appropriate technologies to write easy-to-understand and fast code with a flexible GUI.",

  "description": "In this talk we provide an overview of Pigeons.jl and describe how we addressed the challenges of implementing a distributed, parallelized, and randomized algorithm, exploiting a strong notion of “parallelism invariance” which we will exemplify and motivate. The talk appeals to practitioners who want to leverage distributed computation to perform challenging Bayesian inference tasks or sample from complex distributions such as those arising in statistical mechanics. We briefly describe how Pigeons uses a state-of-the-art method known as non-reversible parallel tempering to efficiently explore challenging posterior distributions. The talk also appeals to a broad array of Julia developers who may want to implement distributed randomized algorithms. The open-source code for Pigeons.jl is available at https://github.com/Julia-Tempering/Pigeons.jl. \r\n\r\nEnsuring code correctness at the intersection of randomized, parallel, and distributed algorithms is a challenge. To address this challenge, we designed Pigeons based on a notion of “parallelism invariance”: the output for a given input should be **identical** regardless of which of the following four scenarios is used: 1. one machine running on one thread, 2. one machine running on several threads, 3. several machines running, each using one thread (in our case, communicating via MPI.jl), and 4. several machines running, each using several threads. Since (1) is significantly simpler to debug and implement than (2, 3, 4), being able to exactly compare the four outputs pointwise (instead of distributional equality checks, which have false positive rates), is a powerful tool to detect software defects. \r\n\r\nTwo factors tend to cause violations of parallelism invariance: (a) task-local and thread-local random number generators, (b) non-associativity of floating point operations. We discuss libraries we have developed to workaround (a) and (b) while preserving the same running time complexity, including a Julia SplittableRandom stream library (https://github.com/UBC-Stat-ML/SplittableRandoms.jl) and a custom distributed MPI reduction in pure Julia.\r\n\r\nJoint work with: Alexandre Bouchard-Côté, Paul Tiede, Miguel Biron-Lattes, Trevor Campbell, and Saifuddin Syed.",

  "description": "Massively parallel hardware architectures such as graphics processing units (GPUs) make it possible to run numerical simulations at unprecedented resolution. Matching the results of simulations to the available observational and experimental data requires estimating the sensitivity of the model to changes in its parameters. The adjoint method for computing sensitivities gains more attention in the scientific and engineering communities. This method allows for computing the sensitivities in the entire parameter space using the results of only one forward solve, in contrast to the direct method that would require runninng the forward simulation for each parameter separately.\r\n\r\nRecent breakthrough innovations in compiler technologies resulted in wide adoption of the paradigm of differentiable programming, in which the entire computer program could be differentiated via automatic differentiation (AD). Differentiable programming allows for automated generation of adjoints from the forward model. In this work, we demonstrate the applications of the adjoint method to inverse modelling in geosciences, and share our experiences using the Julia ecosystem for high-performance computing. We developed massively parallel 3D forward and inverse solvers with full GPU support.

  "description": "The emergence of various micro-architectures gives us hope that application programmers can continue to use higher-performant hardwares even in the era without Dennard scaling. We still see advertisements of newer processors such as GPUs that claim that it is a few times faster than its previous generation. However, on the other hand, the divergence of micro-architecture has produced trouble for application programmers. To enjoy the performance from new hardware, they have to “migrate” their code in order to work with the new hardware, which creates two major costs: the cost of code migration and the cost of maintaining multiple versions.\r\n\r\nIn regards to GPU programming, Julia supports several packages such as CUDA.jl, AMDGPU.jl and oneAPI.jl. Currently, using these packages is a de-facto standard of Julia GPU programming. However, I argue that this approach has demerits seeing from the porting point of view: 1) it does not reduce the cost of code migration and the cost of maintaining multiple versions, 2) it does not support coexistence of multiple GPU programming paradigm such as CUDA and OpenACC, 3) the latest updates in the Julia GPU packages always come next after vendor’s updates.\r\nFirst, the user has to port the entire code to Julia. Even after completing the porting, the user may need to maintain the old application, possibly written in Fortran or C/C++. There could be many reasons for maintaining both versions such as the eco-system that a community has built around the old application. Secondly, supporting coexistence of multiple GPU programming is especially important now when there is no single winner for GPU programming. Instead of betting on a single GPU programming framework, you may want to transit from one framework to another smoothly when a newer framework is desirable. Lastly, it is obvious that the maintainer of the Julia GPU programming framework should wait until the vendor publicly distributes the latest updates.\r\n\r\nJulia Accelerator Interfaces(JAI, https://github.com/grnydawn/AccelInterfaces.jl) tries to solve the three issues identified above by using shared libraries that include GPU kernels and GPU vendor interfaces. JAI consists of three main functions: 1) Julia GPU programming interface using Julia macros. With the macros, Julia programmers can create and run GPU kernels in the way similar to a directive based GPU programming such as OpenACC or OpenMP target. 2) Automated shared library generation that implements kernels and vendor API interfaces. To create the shared library, JAI relies on external vendor-provided compilers instead of Julia internal GPU compilation infra-structure. In this way, JAI can leverage the newest feature of vendor-provided compilers as well as the benefit of Just-in-time (JIT) compilation. 3) Automated call to functions implemented in the shared libraries using Julia ccall interface. Because this boiler-plating works are hidden from JAI user interface, users can write JAI GPU code at high-level abstraction and JAI can accommodate API changes on the vendor-side.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the features of JAI, we ported a Fortran miniWeather (github.com/mrnorman/miniWeather) OpenACC version that simulates weather-like flows for training in parallelizing accelerated HPC architectures to jlweather (https://github.com/grnydawn/jlweather) that utilize an OpenACC-enabled compiler. For the sake of performance comparison, we also ported minWeather to the pure Julia version and to the manually GPU-ported version too. The versions are deployed and executed at two US-based supercomputing centers (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17pDiiMnTuy8oscQ9-NmxEZ7SltWU4dhUrD2-51ot6ew/edit?usp=sharing). The experiments show that the jlweather OpenACC version is about 25% faster than Fortran OpenACC version with medium workload while slower with small workload.\r\n\r\nIn JAI, kernels are not ported to Julia. Instead, the user provides JAI with the body of the kernels in the original languages such as Fortran. And then, JAI generates kernel source files and compiles them to shared libraries. The kernel body is located in an external text file in a simple INI-format file, called KNL file. In a KNL file, multiple versions of kernel-body can co-exist and JAI automatically selects the best version. For example, if a KNL file contains a kernel body in CUDA, HIP, and Fortran version, JAI can first try to select HIP or CUDA version to check if the system supports the framework. If none of them is supported on the system, JAI may select the Fortran version as a backup. This JAI feature for coexisting multiple GPU programming frameworks allows users to migrate code gradually from one kernel to another kernel, not the entire application at once. As of this writing, JAI supports kernel-bodys written in CUDA, HIP, Fortran-OpenACC, Fortran-OpenMP-Target, Fortran, and C/C++.",

  "description": "The multiple dispatch paradigm of Julia makes it very easy to extend functionality to new types. A package can just define a new method of a generic function that accepts a type in another package, and anyone that calls that function with that type will get the extended behavior. An example of this could be a plotting package that extends a plotting method to various types in the Julia ecosystem.\r\n\r\nHowever, to extend a method with a type from another package, one needs to make that package a dependency. This has a cost, most noticeably in package load time. This means that for a package author, there is always a conflict between wanting to provide useful method extensions and keeping the load time of the package small.\r\n\r\nThe go-to solution for the problem above has been the Requires.jl package. In Requires.jl one defines a piece of code that gets automatically executed when another package is loaded. This code typically adds some extra method for one of the types in the package. Since you are not directly depending on the package, you no longer unconditionally pay the loading cost of it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Requires.jl comes with some drawbacks:\r\n- The code that gets executed when a package gets loaded is `eval`-ed into the module which means that that code can not be precompiled, leading to worse latency.\r\n- It is not possible to set any compatibility constraints on the packages triggering the\r\n- Requires.jl had issues with PackageCompiler since it needed access to files during runtime.\r\n\r\nThe new [\"package extension\"](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/dev/creating-packages/#Conditional-loading-of-code-in-packages-(Extensions)) functionality in 1.9 is meant to fully replace the usage of Requires.jl while solving the issues mentioned above. This talk will give an overview of how the new extension system works, discuss best practices and give some examples of its usage from the package ecosystem.",

To our knowledge, the Julia community currently lacks a native and feature-complete package for generic high-dimensional Monte Carlo integration. Our package addresses this gap by providing a carefully tested, well-documented, officially registered solution that supports multiple algorithms and both MPI and threading parallelization. In Monte Carlo integration, the user must implement an integrand evaluation function evaluated millions or even billions of times. Julia's speed and flexibility make this task significantly easier for the user compared to similar packages in C/C++/Fortran and Python.

  "description": "Sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification, and inverse design tasks typically involve computing a gradient with respect to a loss function modeling the objective in a computer program. Handling objectives that require the numerical simulation of a differential equation with discontinuities, such as in pharmacology applications involving drug dosing, is of great interest. In the forward simulation of an (ordinary or stochastic) differential equation, discontinuities can be implemented using callbacks. However, the computation of the derivatives can be challenging: Discrete sensitivity analysis techniques based on automatic differentiation (AD) packages may scale poorly with the number of parameters (in the case of forward-mode AD) or have a large memory footprint due to the caching of intermediate values (in the case of reverse-mode AD). Therefore, it is highly desirable to make continuous adjoints compatible with callbacks as well. In this talk, we present continuous-adjoint sensitivity methods for hybrid differential equations that model explicit and implicit events and are available within the SciMLSensitivity.jl package.",

  "description": "Since half a century, the notion of Copulas, introduced by Sklar in 1959, is the standard approach to model complex dependence structures in multivariate random vectors. In a broad range of domains, multivariate statistics and dependence structure modeling is an important part of the statistical treatment of the information, and therefore many applied domains have widely adopted copulas frameworks.\r\n\r\nIn Julia, the probabilistic and statistical ecosystem is centered on `Distributions.jl`, which provides the standard tools to deal with random variables. `Copulas.jl` provides many standard tools to model dependencies *between* random variables: evaluation of probabilities and moments, Kendall's tau, Spearmann's rho, distribution function and density evaluation, fitting models to data through inverse moments or loglikelyhood maximization, etc, are available for a wide range of classical parametric copula families. Moreover, the Sklar type, mimicking Sklar's Theorem, allows building full models including the Copulas and marginal specifications. These complex multivariate models are compatible with the broader `Distributions.jl` ecosystem, allowing to, e.g., plug them directly into `Turing.jl` for Bayesian applications.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present the new tools that we developed, their integration to the ecosystem, and we showcase the new functionalities that are now available to the practitioner.

  "description": "Computational workflows and pipelines are essential in large-scale data analysis and bioinformatics. Julia is a fast and easy-to-learn language, powered with parallel implementation and suited to glue together multiple languages and data types. Those features support Julia to be a potential workflow language. \r\nHere, we present two packages, Pipelines.jl and JobSchedulers.jl, as the Julia-based pipeline builder and workload manager. Pipelines.jl is a lightweight and powerful package for building reusable pipelines. JobSchedulers.jl was inspired by Slurm and PBS, and supports allocating CPU and memory to a specific job and deferring a job until other jobs are finished. Julia or external code can wrap in a Program type, and Pipelines.jl provides the code with multiple features, including inputs and outputs validation, dependency check, resuming interrupted tasks, re-trying failed tasks, and skipping finished tasks.\r\nPipelines.jl and JobSchedulers.jl have been used in Clasnip (www.clasnip.com), a web-based microorganism classification service with Julia back-end. In addition, BioPipelines.jl is an implementation of Pipelines.jl. It integrates a collection of bioinformatics programs and is fully compatible with PackageCompiler.jl. It solves the relocation of Julia applications and the configuration of external dependencies used in workflows.\r\nTherefore, by combining JobSchedulers.jl and Pipelines.jl, developers and researchers can conveniently build reproducible and scalable workflows in Julia.",

  "description": "The IsoDAR (Isotope Decay-At-Rest) experiment is a proposed source of neutrinos: light, electrically neutral fundamental particles with many properties that physics has yet to explain. IsoDAR creates neutrinos by irradiating a Li-7 target with a beam of protons. This beam of protons is proposed to carry an unprecedented 10 mA of current, made possible in part by the inclusion of a linear accelerator called a Radiofrequency Quadrupole (RFQ). Simulating the behavior of a beam as it traverses an RFQ of arbitrary design is nontrivial already, but once the beam current becomes as high as 10 mA, nonlinear space charge effects make these computations even more difficult. In response, we have used Julia to develop neural networks that can predict throughgoing beam dynamics accurately and quickly, orders of magnitude faster than traditional high-fidelity simulation. In this contribution, we present the current performance of such surrogate models, discuss their pitfalls in predicting less straightforward beam summary parameters, and highlight their utility for accelerator engineering and design optimization.",

These surrogate models have the potential to transform the way physicists design and optimize accelerators."

  "description": "Peridynamics uses an integral equation to describe the relative displacements and forces between material particles. Because this equation is also defined for material discontinuities, this method can conveniently be employed to model the spontaneous formation of cracks and fragments. Multiple material models of peridynamics were shown to correctly map complex fracture problems with various materials.\r\n\r\nThe package Peridynamics.jl is designed to make it easily usable and includes various features that help to set up simulations. The capability to model damage and crack growth due to contact with multiple bodies makes it a valuable tool for many applications. Extending the package with new material models is easily possible due to multiple-dispatch and Julia's powerful type system.",

  "description": "Phylogenetics is the study of evolutionary relationships between organisms or groups. These relationships are often depicted in a tree structure, where internal nodes represent hypothetical ancestral species and external nodes (leaves) represent extant organisms or species. Over the past few decades, though, the importance of biological processes which cannot be represented in a tree structure (such as hybridization, introgression, and more) has become more well-known, which has led to a drastic increase in depicting these relationships with directed networks.\r\n\r\nMany common procedures for estimating such species trees and networks begin by estimating a collection of many gene trees from sequence data. These gene trees can be discordant even if a tree model is sufficient for modeling the species relationship, due to a process called incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Thus, one of the main difficulties with model-based approaches is that it is difficult to disentangle what proportion of gene trees are adequately explained by a tree structure and ILS, and what proportion requires a network structure to be explained.\r\n\r\nOur package RANSANEC.jl (RAndom SAmple NEtwork Consensus) implements the classical statistical method of RANSAC (RAndom SAmple Consensus) in phylogenetic tree-space in order to separate the set of estimated gene trees which are adequately explained by ILS and a tree structure and those which require a network structure. This software builds on the rapidly growing suite of phylogenetic analysis software available in Julia.",

Many species tree and network estimation procedures first estimate a set of gene trees from sequence data.

  "description": "Model Predictive Control (MPC) provides a powerful framework to control a dynamical system and is particularly useful for nonlinear systems that may have constraints on states as well as a general objective function. The concept is to use a prediction model of the future response of the system and then determine the optimal control inputs that optimize the future evolved trajectory. Thus, an (expensive) online optimizer is called at each time step with the requirement that a solution is available before the next time step. The first of these control inputs is then passed onto the plant model (or actual system). An observer (such as a Kalman filter or variants) is used to provide an estimate of the system state which is fed back to the predictive controller for the next time step. The need for an online optimizer commonly results in a limitation of the sample rate of the system or the length of the prediction horizon which may make MPC intractable for nonlinear systems with fast dynamics. Furthermore, it necessitates verification of the optimizer especially for safety-critical applications. \r\n\r\nThis work presents an alternative approach for optimizer-free control that both results in a substantial speedup over online optimization and removes the need for optimizer verification. The method followed is to simulate the MPC controller for several sampled reference conditions as well as initial states and train a neural network-based surrogate to learn the control law from the simulated data. We discuss the philosophy followed and highlight the benefits and drawbacks of constructing a surrogate for the optimizer versus for both the optimizer and the observer. We apply and benchmark the tool developed to several practically-relevant problems arising from various industries such as aerospace and chemical engineering. We also demonstrate the ability of the surrogate controller to reject disturbances and deal with set-point changes. With these examples, we show 100-150x speed-ups with low training errors compared to online optimization. \r\n\r\nLastly, we present the use of the toolkit in a typical workflow of a control engineer starting from the development of a dynamic system model (e.g., using ModelingToolkit.jl) to the development of the MPC model and finally to surrogatization and analysis in order to highlight its use as an enabling technology especially for control of fast nonlinear systems.",
