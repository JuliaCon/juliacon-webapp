  "description": "There is currently a very large gap from new robotics research to commercial products. The two language problem contributes to this gap, where research and prototyping often occurs in MATLAB or Python and then field testing and commercialization requires porting to C or C++. The development speed, runtime speed, and scientific computing capabilities of Julia offer a promising solution to this challenge.\r\n\r\nKEF Robotics is developing an attachable autonomy subsystem for small aerial vehicles, allowing us to add navigation, hazard avoidance, and machine learning capabilities to any drone, all with just cameras (no GPS required). Our hazard detection and avoidance module has been developed, tested, fielded, and is now being transitioned into a commercial product, all in Julia. This module combines widely varying components, including image processing, geometric computer vision, splines, and nonlinear optimization, making it a perfect showcase for Julia's unique strength in composability and scientific computing.\r\n\r\nAnother key challenge in robotics is predictable real-time performance, often on embedded computing. These factors are typically not associated with garbage-collected scripting languages. While Julia's tooling and runtime are not perfect for the task, options for allocation management, profiling, and package compilation allow prototype code to be ported to these applications, all in the same language. Also, Julia native CUDA programming is of particular utility for NVIDIA's Jetson products, which are prevalent in robotics research and commercialization.",

  "description": "Linear maps (or operators) are ubiquitous in the mathematical sciences, modeling and scientific computing. In many problems, linear maps are not necessarily given by some matrix representation, but as programs that transform vectors in a linear fashion. Such linear programs can be used, for instance, in iterative linear algebra methods synonymously to usual matrices by wrapping them with the `LinearMaps.jl` package. With this package, more complicated linear maps can be constructed lazily from simple linear function maps or wrapped matrices via scaling, addition, multiplication, transposition and taking the adjoint. Recently, two further classes of such operator algebraic operations have been added to the aforementioned traditional set of operations in `LinearMaps.jl`: horizontal, vertical and diagonal (block) concatenation  and Kronecker products, sums, and powers. These operations feature prominently in applications like structured optimization and image reconstruction. Their implementation in `LinearMaps.jl` facilitates top performance even in the classic matrix context due to their laziness and type-stable usage of specialized multiplication methods.",

  "description": "Many studies have shown that proper human resource management is vital to the success of any organisation. This means that managers need to balance the needs of the organisation with the needs of their employees, and are required to make well-informed planning decisions. One part of the problem covers short term planning, such as setting up employee rosters to ensure an appropriate distribution of the workload over the employees. The other part deals with long term manpower planning, and usually concerns hiring and promotion policies to meet the organisation’s goals without alienating its employees. Naturally, any of the planning decisions have to be made within a certain legal framework that the organisation cannot influence.\r\nAs such, such decisions are too important to be left to the manager’s \"gut feeling\". Instead, they can rely on a variety of mathematical models to provide invaluable insights to allow them to make the appropriate decisions. These models can be of various types: Markov models, optimisation models using mathematical programming, stochastic simulation models, or system dynamics models, each with their own benefits and drawbacks.\r\nIn particular, we have chosen to develop a tool, the Generic Manpower Simulation Engine (GMSE), based on stochastic simulation, as an organisation’s internal structure and policies are often too complex and varied to be able to estimate all the effects of a particular change. Instead, our tool allows the user to define the structure of the organisation and its policies, entering only the direct effect these policies have on the personnel members of that organisation. Once the system is configured, the user can then run the simulation for the period of interest, and request reports on the state of the organisation at any time point covered by the simulation. This allows the user to get a prediction of the full impact of specific proposed policy changes, among other applications.\r\nThe GMSE is developed entirely in Julia with the SimJulia library at its core, and provides all the necessary methods to fully configure a manpower simulation from within Julia for the expert user, as well as a way to configure one from MS Excel.\r\nIn addition to giving an overview of the GMSE, we will show how we use the SimJulia library, and we illustrate some of the challenges we faced, and how we decided to handle those challenges. Finally, we give a quick overview of how we can use the GMSE to optimise the organisation’s policies.",

  "description": "Random-number generators present a special problem for both thread- and process-based parallelism, especially when guaranteeing a reproducible, unbiased stream that is independent of the number of concurrent workers. In other words, we require the ability to parallelize a replicated, stochastic operation in such a way that we will get the same result as the serial computation with the same RNG and seed. For thread-based parallelism, this can easily be achieved via a shared RNG with appropriate locking.  We demonstrate this with the implementation of the parametric bootstrap in MixedModels. The parametric bootstrap is embarrassingly parallel computation, yet depends on a stochastic element and thus random-number generation.  In particular, we examine how the granularity of locking impacts the 'striping' of random numbers across threads and thus reproducibility. We finish by contrasting our approach to the use of 'fast-forwarding' and copying the RNG and discussing issues with generalizing these approaches to process-based parallelism.",

We will show how the package is built on top of Distributions.jl, thus allowing easy integration of any distribution, including more obscure ones, for example, a non-zero mean Student’s t which employs the `LocationScale` abstraction. The package also has a manual for integrating new distributions with small effort.\r\nFinally, we will motivate the use of this class of models by providing examples of applications in different fields, e.g., simulating scenarios for renewable generation and analyzing financial time-series data, while showcasing the use of the package.\r\nFor more information on score-driven models, we refer the interested reader to http://www.gasmodel.com.",

  "description": "Machine learning datasets are samples taken from a domain and an underlying data generating distribution.  For example, the MNIST dataset is a sample from the set of all 28x28 grayscale images (the domain) that are created by humans writing the digits 0-9 (the data generating distribution).  The examples in datasets are used to train models to perform machine learning tasks; for MNIST, the task is usually “what digit is this?” but the task could also be “is this digit odd?” or “was this digit written by a left-handed person?”  Creating the label for each example--evaluating the task applied to that example--usually requires some sort of human effort.\r\n\r\nLattice.jl provides a framework for describing and abstracting domains, data generating distributions, and machine learning tasks for those problems where it is possible for a computer program to automatically generate examples.  To explain the usefulness of such a framework, consider generating examples from an image domain. Since Lattice first generates a simple internal representation of the example and then uses the representation to draw the image, it is also possible to automatically create perfect labels for a wide variety of different tasks applied to each image.  The labels and generating distributions can be manipulated to simulate many different kinds of labeling error and bias, and these problems can be introduced to completely different datasets in a systematic way.\r\n\r\nThis talk will provide a brief overview of the motivation and use cases for Lattice, and then show how the library relies on Julia’s type system to automatically pair abstract machine learning tasks with all of the domains where the tasks make sense.  (For example, the abstract task “is X contained by Y?” can be instantiated and applied to images with at least two polygons, or images with bitmaps of a bird and a cage, but not to images of a single digit.  In Lattice, pairs of domains and tasks don't need to be manually specified.)  We’ll also show how multiple dispatch in Julia makes the implementation of Lattice--and the addition of new domains and tasks--remarkably simple.  Finally, we'll share a few examples of using Lattice datasets with Flux.jl to study representation learning and hyperparameter optimization.",

  "description": "To adopt modern practices for reproducible data science, enterprises need to first know what kinds of data they have. In some industries like financial services, being able to reproduce critical risk calculations is even a regulatory requirement. A necessary first step is for enterprises to build comprehensive data catalogue, before building other infrastructure such as data lakes. Building such a catalogue can be challenging for enterprises with multiple legacy systems, incomplete documentation, and inherited technical debt. The expert knowledge needed to provide and verify subject labels further escalates the cost of building a data catalogue.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I demonstrate how topic modeling can be used to help build a comprehensive data catalogue from incomplete subject labels and access to metadata such as low-level record types and database table names. By treating such metadata as a sequence of tokens, similar to natural text, I show how to construct semisupervised topic models that allow extrapolation from existing labels. First, I show how a gauge transformation of a standard topic modeling technique, latent semantic indexing (LSI), yields a labelled topic model that is explictly separable. Next, I show how to use generalized low-rank models (GLRMs), as implemented in `GeneralizedLowRankModels.jl`, to explicitly construct a labelled topic model that is a sparse, interpretable, and separable generalization of principal components analysis. I show how to implement a new regularizer in Julia, including an implementation of its corresponding proximal gradient operator. Furthermore, I show how to modify the code of `GeneralizedLowRankModels.jl` to take advantage of the new multithreading model in Julia 1.3 for near-perfect parallel speedup. Additionally, numerical tricks such as low-precision iterative linear algebra, randomized subsampling, and warm starts help to make efficient the training of a GLRM via proximal gradient descent.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the technique, I will show how this new topic model performs on predicting subject tags on over 25,000 datasets from Kaggle.com. The GLRM-based topic model can be used for several different semisupervised learning tasks, like extrapolating from known labels, evaluating possible errors in existing labels, and predicting missing metadata.",

The problem of hedging is viewed as an optimal\r\nstatistical decision under the agent's posterior predictive\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\nCrucially, option pricing and hedging are performed under the\r\nreal-world pricing distribution and do not rely upon assumptions\r\nof risk neutrality. While we do not rely upon risk-neutral\r\nassumptions, conditions of risk-neutrality are obtained in the limit\r\nin the absence of market frictions.

  "description": "A general compiler can only have so much knowledge, but when we know that someone is solving a differential equation, there are a million things that we know. We know that different sizes of differential equations will do better/worse with different solver methods, we know that sparsity of the Jacobian will have a large impact on the speed of computation, we know that the user's `f` function describing the ODE can be considered independently from the rest of the program, and so on. In DifferentialEquations.jl, we have codified these ideas in order to build a toolchain that automatically optimizes a user's `f` function in order to spit out a more optimized DEProblem.\r\n\r\nThis works by first tracing to a symbolic sublanguage, ModelingToolkit.jl. By using tasks to time-out, we can try performing an auto-trace which, if successful, gives us a complete symbolic mathematical description of the user's numerical code. We can then proceed to symbolically analyze the function to generate the analytical solution to the user's Jacobian and even symbolically factorize the Jacobian, if doable in the allotted time. From the symbolic world we can then auto-parallelize the generated Julia code, chunking the output into tasks to multithread, or using a cost model determine that the ODE is large enough to automatically distribute (with auto-GPU coming soon).\r\n\r\nIf the system is not symbolically trace-able (there is a while loop depending on an input value, something that is quite uncommon), then we can resort to IR-based and adaptive analysis. We will demonstrate how SparsityDetection.jl can automatically identify the sparsity pattern of the Jacobian for a Julia code and then use SparseDiffTools.jl to accelerate the solve of stiff equations by performing a matrix coloring and optimizing the Jacobian construction for the problem. We will then discuss how DifferentialEquations.jl automatically picks the solver algorithm, defaulting to methods which can automatically switch between stiff and non-stiff integrators, determining stiffness on the fly with heuristics.\r\n\r\nTogether, we have demonstrated that these auto-optimizations can improve the code of even experienced Julia programmers by >100x by enabling sparsity coloring optimizations that they may not have known about, and by parallelizing code that is either difficult to parallelize or is simply automatically generated and thus hard to intervene with.",

  "description": "In this talk, I will present Algebra of Graphics, a novel take on the Grammar of Graphics (GoG) approach to plotting.\r\n\r\nIn GoG (available in Julia thanks to for example Gadfly.jl or VegaLite.jl), a tabular dataset is used to inform how a plot should look like. Different columns correspond to different plot attributes, according to different scales. On top of that, columns can be transformed using \"statistics\", which in turn will inform what plot function to use (e.g. bar plot or scatter plot).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the recipe framework, implemented in the Plots.jl and Makie.jl packages, custom types are recursively transformed into simpler types, until a suitable visualization is found.\r\n\r\nI will show how [AlgebraOfGraphics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/AlgebraOfGraphics.jl) (the successor of StatsMakie.jl) attempts to bridge the gap between the two approaches, as it implements a version of Grammar of Graphics based on custom types and multiple dispatch. In particular, a combination of custom types (`Style` and `Analysis`) can be used to express how data should be grouped, styled, and analyzed (see [examples](http://juliaplots.org/AlgebraOfGraphics.jl/dev/generated/tutorial/)).\r\nThese basic types can then be combined using the `+` and `*` operators.\r\n\r\nThe interface is declarative. The \"translation\" from data columns to plot attributes relies on a default theme, which can be customized, thus changing the \"look\" of all visualization consistently.\r\n\r\nAs the library is implemented in pure Julia, users are not limited to pre-built analyses but can implement their own, and they will automatically be integrated in the framework. This GoG-inspired framework, can then be combined with Makie's plot functions, as well as with the plot functions provided in StatsMakie.jl (such as boxplot or violin plot) or in other external packages.\r\n\r\nAn added benefit of the GoG approach is that many different plot commands can be expressed with a uniform syntax. This greatly simplifies the creation of interactive user interfaces for data analysis, where the user can select (from e.g. dropdown menus) what columns of a dataset to use, what analysis to run, and how to group and style the data. I will show a simple UI to create visualizations of a tabular dataset interactively.",

The goal is to get those in the workshop familiar with what these methods are, what kinds of problems they solve, and know how to use Julia packages to implement them.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will jump right into how to model the missing part of a physical simulation, describe how universal approximators (neural networks) can be used in this context, and show how to transform such problems into an optimization problem which is then accelerated by specializing automatic differentiation. The set of packages that is involved in this is somewhat intense, using many tools from JuliaDiffEq ([DiffEqFlux.jl](https://diffeqflux.sciml.ai/dev/), DifferentialEquations.jl, DiffEqSensitivity.jl, ModelingToolkit.jl, [NeuralPDE.jl](https://neuralpde.sciml.ai/dev/), DataDrivenDiffEq.jl, Surrogates.jl, etc.) combined with machine learning tools (Flux.jl), differentiation tooling (SparseDiffTools.jl, Zygote.jl, ForwardDiff.jl, ReverseDiff.jl, etc.), and optimization tooling (JuMP, Optim.jl, Flux.jl, NLopt.jl, etc.) all spun together in a glorious soup that automatically discovers physical laws at the end of the day. Thus this workshop has something different to offer for everyone: new users of Julia will get a nice overview of the unique composibility of the Julia package ecosystem, while experienced Julia users will learn how to bridge some area that they are comfortable with (such as machine learning) to a whole new set of phenomena. Meanwhile, even though who are only knee deep in coding can gain a lot from learning these new mathematical advances, meaning that even a casual observer likely has a lot to learn!",

  "description": "Incremental computation reframes the way we build responsive systems such as databases, compilers, ML applications, spreadsheets, and web apps. Performing the minimal amount of computation needed to update a result means avoiding re-running a full computation, boosting performance.\r\n\r\nModern compilers are one such challenging responsive system. Programmers expect tools (Atom, VSCode) to understand their programs _while typing_, and to provide syntax highlighting, cross-linking, error indicators, auto-completion and documentation. IDEs essentially need a full-blown compiler front-end. To facilitate this, modern compilers are no longer designed as batch compilers consisting of distinct passes, but rather with on-demand usage as a primary use case (eg by allowing cheaply type-checking a function while accepting errors).\r\n\r\nTo meet this challenge, state-of-the-art compilers employ generic frameworks for incremental computing. Rust uses the [salsa](https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa) framework (see this [PLISS 2019 recording](https://youtu.be/N6b44kMS6OM) for an in-depth discussion).\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we introduce [Salsa.jl](https://github.com/RelationalAI-oss/Salsa.jl), which is inspired by Rust's salsa. Salsa.jl (like incremental computing frameworks in general) takes away the guesswork in building efficient incremental systems through its automatic dependency tracking and cache invalidation via versioning. Salsa.jl also introduces novel incremental computation features such as _maintaining_ computations, recursion, and improved dependency analysis. For example, thanks to Julia, Salsa is extensible and supports using existing automatic differentiation tools to maintain computations.\r\n\r\nWe use Salsa in production to build a declarative programming language and database system with fast incremental evaluation and immediate feedback. As a novel use-case, we show how Salsa makes it easy to implement a multi-stage language where compilation and evaluation are interleaved.\r\n\r\nWe show how to use Salsa to build a small on-demand compiler and an incremental spreadsheet that is correct by construction.\r\n\r\nSalsa takes advantage of Julia's meta-programming features and design choices, such as macros, dynamic computation, multiple dispatch, excellent performance, and bias towards immutable data structures. This talk demonstrates that Julia is a remarkably pleasant and productive language for implementing compilers and for incremental computation more broadly.",

In contrast, the library makes use of lazy-data structures that represent objects (e.g., elemental matrices and vectors) on the entire computational domain. This allows us the library developers to hide assembly loops and other core computations from the user-code leading to a very compact, user-friendly, syntax.  `Gridap` is designed both for research and teaching purposes.

These types of problems are combinatorially hard to solve and consumed significant staff-hours for manually coming up with decent allotments. We model such allotment problems as a Bipartite graph matching and develop a stochastic optimization approach to obtain an approximate solution. We developed a computational approach requiring no manual effort, which offers better allotments than previous manual solutions. We initially implemented this in Python, which brought down the time required for obtaining an allotment to a couple of CPU-hours. By reimplementing the solver in Julia, we got a speedup of 13x over the Python implementation. In particular, we were surprised to find how fast Julia is for implementing iterative algorithms.",

  "description": "In Julia, some objects are *mutable* (`Array`, `mutable struct`, `...`), while others are *immutable* (`Tuple`, `struct`, `...`). Neither is strictly better than the other in every situation. However, *immutability* usually leads to code that is easier to reason about, for both humans and compilers. And therefore less buggy and more performant programs.\r\nOne convenience with mutability is, that it makes updating objects very simple:\r\n\r\n`spaceship.captain.name = \"Julia\"`\r\n\r\nThe analogous operation in the immutable case is to create a copy of `spaceship`, with just the captain's name changed to \"Julia\".\r\nJust think for a moment, how would you achieve this? It is a serious obstacle to adopting immutables in practice. The title \"Changing the immutable\" refers to this and similar problems. There are various approaches, for instance, https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/21912 .\r\n\r\nI would like to talk about this problem and present one solution, namely [`Setfield.jl`](https://github.com/jw3126/Setfield.jl).

  "description": "One of the most efficient algorithms for solving hydrothermal operation planning problems, which are large-scale multi-stage stochastic models, is the so-called stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) algorithm. Operation planning of power systems aims to assess the value of the scarce resources (e.g. water) to feed short-term dispatch models used in the actual implementation of the decisions. When the planning model significantly deviates from the reality of the implemented operation, decision policies are said to be time-inconsistent. Recent literature has explored different sources of inconsistency such as time-inconsistent dynamic risk measures, inaccurate representation of the information process and simplifications in the network planning model. This work addresses the time-inconsistency due to simplifications in the network representation in the planning model extending the existing literature.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this work is to propose a framework, comprised of a methodology and an open-source computational package, for testing the operative and economic impact of modeling simplifications over the network power-flow in hydrothermal power systems. \r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will discuss how the [HydroPowerModels.jl](https://github.com/andrewrosemberg/HydroPowerModels.jl) package models hydrothermal operation planning problems and how we have to use it to study the impacts of time-inconsistency in the operation of hydrothermal power systems.",

  "description": "Industry 4.0 engenders and analysis data across the machines in iIndustry to produce high-quality products at low costs, and changes traditional production relationships among suppliers, producers, and customers. Industry 4.0 amalgamates nine technologies to transform industrial production, which includes: (1) Big Data Analytics, (2) Autonomous Robots/ Robotics, (3) Simulation, (4) Horizontal & Vertical System Integration, (5) Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), (6) Cybersecurity, (7) Cloud Computing, (8) Additive Manufacturing (such as 3-D printing), and (9) Augmented Reality. I4.0 uses Decision Support Systems (DSS) incorporating with knowledge mining techniques to know what actions need to take in future that help manufacturers to optimise their operations quickly. The fourth revolution ameliorates the industries with intelligent computing fuelled by data with Machine Learning (ML) and Data Mining (DM) technologies. In this talk, we have addressed several issues for knowledge mining process in Industry 4.0 using Julia programming language. Knowledge mining is the process of extracting hidden information/patters from Industrial Big Data (iBigData) to lucid market trends, customer preferences and other information that’s useful to businesses. Industrial Big Data is extremely large that we can't store all the data into a single computer/machine; so, we need more scalable and robust learning approach to deal with iBigData. We have collected the data set with 1067371 instances named “Online Retail II” from UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/) and implemented RainForest and BOAT (Bootstrapped Optimistic Algorithm for Tree construction) learning algorithms using Julia. RainForest and BOAT are basically decision tree (DT) based supervised learning algorithms for classifying Big Data. We have presented a new decision tree merging approach that addresses the repetition and replication problems in tree pruning. Industrial Big Data is multivariate, high-dimensional, noisy, and also the characteristics of data can be changed over the time (e.g. concept drifting in data streaming environment). In this talk, we also discussed the how we can handle the noisy and streaming data; find the most informative training instances, so that we can build a learning model with minimum number of instances. For selecting informative training instances, we have used simple partition-based clustering approach and implemented clustering algorithm in Julia.",

  "description": "Numerical simulations can be expressed as solving the mathematical equations--derived from the modeling--and/or processing the data obtained from those equations. Based on the properties of the system at hand and the level of abstraction in the modeling, the mathematical equations may be ordinary, stochastic, delay differential or difference equations. Although different simulation environments have been developed for numerical simulations of systems, they are able to simulate mostly the models represented by ordinary differential or differential-algebraic equations. This is restrictive when considering the diversity of mathematical models that can be encountered. In Jusdl.jl, it is possible to simulate discrete-time and continuous-time, static or dynamical systems. In particular, it is possible to simulate dynamical systems modeled by different types of differential equations such as ODE(Ordinary Differential Equation), Random Ordinary Differential Equation(RODE), SDE(Stochastic Differential Equation), DDE(Delay Differential Equation) and DAE(Differential-Algebraic Equation), and discrete difference equations. During the simulation, the data flowing through the links of the model can be processed online and specialized analyzes can be performed. These analyses can also be enriched with plugins that can be defined using the standard Julia library or various Julia packages. The simulation is performed by evolving model components individually and in parallel in sampling time intervals. The individual evolution of the components allows the simulation of the models including the components that are represented by different kinds of mathematical equations.\r\n\r\nKey features of Jusdl.jl includes\r\n* Simulation of a large class of systems: \r\n    * Static systems (whose input, output relation is represented by a functional relation)\r\n    * Dynamical systems (whose input, state and output relation is represented by difference or differential equations)\r\n        * Dynamical systems modelled by continuous time differential equations: ODE, DAE, RODE, SDE, DDE\r\n        * Dynamics systems modelled by discrete time difference equations.\r\n* Simulation of models consisting of components that are represented by different type mathematical equations\r\n* Individual construction of components, no need to construct a unique equation representing the whole model\r\n* Online data analysis through plugins \r\n* Flexibility to enrich the data analysis scope through user-defined plugins",

This allows the construction of domain specific logics that can capture the reasoning systems employed by programmers, scientists, and engineers in differing applications. The Julia type system is sufficiently sophisticated to support implementations of these domain specific logics, while the metaprogramming facilities support the implementation of domain specific languages for describing systems within these domain specific logics. \r\n\r\nThis talk will illustrate how features of Julia interact to create an ideal environment for implementing such abstract and mathematical structure in code, and feature some specific applications to the technical computing community. Such examples include, reasoning about linear maps graphically, constructing scientific models of chemical or biological systems via model composition, and hierarchical design of complex systems. The algebraic approach used in this ecosystem illustrates how many techniques in computer science that represent processes as graphs with mathematical interpretations are related on a deep level. The generic programming capabilities of julia combined with low cost abstractions allow us to realize this similarity in the structure of our software, which reveals and leverages the similarity between application areas to build cohesive tooling for diverse applications.\r\n\r\nThis talk will present code developed in the Catlab.jl, Petri.jl, and SemanticModels.jl packages.",

  "description": "Network ecology is the novel approach to studying biodiversity. In that respect, this presentation provides an overview of three brand-new packages (`Mangal`, `EcologicalNetworks`, and `EcologicalNetworksPlots`) written by Timothée Poisot and collaborators, which were created in response to the increasing need to handle species interaction data in Julia. Built around state-of-the-art practices in network ecology, they largely facilitate the analysis and visualization of almost all types of species interaction networks. In these, two species are linked together if they can interact.\r\n\r\nThe `Mangal` package is a wrapper around the Mangal database, which is among the world's most exhaustive open source database of ecological interactions. The Mangal database contains 172 well-documented datasets for a total of 1300 ecological networks worldwide. It encompasses various types of ecological networks, including predation (food webs), pollination and parasitism networks.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the `EcologicalNetworksPlots` package implements the visualization of ecological networks, whereas `EcologicalNetworks` provides functions for the analysis of their emergent structure. The structure of species interaction networks is a rich source of information, as it is associated with the stability, dynamics, and functions of biological communities. The `EcologicalNetworks` package is the only one designed to conduct such a specialized analysis in Julia. It is also a suitable tool for the simulation of networks under different sets of assumptions and ecological models. These two packages use a well-documented type system for networks in order to capture the various types of data typically handled by network ecologists. This makes them easily extensible and somewhat fast.\r\n\r\nTogether, these three packages provide an extremely valuable methodological framework for the analysis of ecological networks in Julia. Our presentation offers an overview of their key features and depicts some of their concrete applications in this complex and emerging subfield of biology. It is aimed at ecologists among the Julia community, but also more broadly at network scientists and other attendees fascinated by networks and graphs.",

  "description": "In the Julia documentation, the [example of `Point{T}`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.3/manual/types/#Parametric-Composite-Types-1) is used to introduce parametric types. It is easy to implement your own point type, and many packages have done so. For users, having to convert their points from package A to package B can be bothersome. Besides points, the same applies to other geometries such as lines and polygons, which are commonly used in geospatial workflows. Just agreeing on a single set of types for all uses is unlikely, since the diversity stems from different needs. Some may want to match a particular file format, or wrap pointers through a C API, such as GDAL.\r\n\r\nHence, to embrace the diversity and allow smooth workflows involving different geometry representations, we redesigned [GeoInterface.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeo/GeoInterfaceRFC.jl). It allows you to efficiently convert between any sets of types that implement the interface, without having to know about or depend on the other package. The redesign incorporates many ideas from the Simple Features standard, and was inspired by the success of the [Tables.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/Tables.jl) interface. Interestingly, we can show examples how these two interfaces can complement each other for tabular data with geometry columns, as seen in [Shapefile.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeo/Shapefile.jl) and [GeoJSONTables.jl](https://github.com/visr/GeoJSONTables.jl).",

The user survey was last conducted at the beginning of 2020 and a summary of the results will be presented during the lightning talk.\r\n\r\nThere are so many fantastic ideas and features the Binder project team (https://jupyterhub-team-compass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/team.html#binder-team) would like to develop but - like many open source projects - we face time restrictions, a low bus factor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor), and often lack domain expertise when developing language-specific features.\r\n\r\nSarah Gibson would like to introduce the Binder Project to the Julia community as an opportunity to shape a tool that would be most useful to them and provide guidance on how to get started with contributing to or joining the project.\r\n\r\nThis lightning talk will (hopefully!) be accompanied by a Birds of a Feather session and/or a drop-in table where Sarah will be available for more in-depth discussions about Binder.",

We use Julia and JuMP for large-scale optimization on the current generation of supercomputers. However, the recent switch from CPU to GPU in the upcoming generation of supercomputers poses great challenges for classic optimization algorithms. Sparse algebra and linear solvers are known to have poor performance on GPUs. Our project looks into novel optimization algorithms that are applied to the alternate current optimal power flow (ACOPF) problem. Current solvers supported by JuMP largely rely on sparse linear solvers. Our goal is to find algorithms that rely on denser algebra that scales over the large number of cores that a GPU provides. We present a complete software stack from modeling to the linear solver that is written completely in Julia and provide an end-to-end overview of the challenges met both at the modeling level as well as at the algebra level. We use automatic differentiation to generate the derivative code for the GPUs and show performance results for the power flow problem (PF) that look promising to be extended to OPF.",

Beside a computational performance that is often close to or better than Stan, DynamicPPL provides an intuitive domain-specific language (DSL) that allows the rapid development of complex dynamic probabilistic programs. Being entirely written in Julia, a high-level dynamic programming language for numerical computing, DynamicPPL inherits a rich set of features available through the Julia ecosystem. Since DynamicPPL is a modular, stand-alone library, any probabilistic programming system written in Julia, such as Turing.jl, can use DynamicPPL to specify models and trace their model parameters. The main features of DynamicPPL are: 1) a meta-programming based DSL for specifying dynamic models using an intuitive tilde-based notation; 2) a tracing data-structure for tracking random variables in dynamic probabilistic models; 3) a rich contextual dispatch system allowing tailored behaviour during model execution; and 4) a user-friendly syntax for probabilistic queries.

  "description": "Since Google unveiled its knowledge graph in 2012 and Amazon released its product graph in 2018, enterprises have been building knowledge graphs to try to leverage their varied collections of big data for predictive analytics and AI projects. There are many roadblocks that stand in the way, including system complexity and development time, but also query performance and scalability issues. In this talk, we explain how a next-generation knowledge graph database -- built entirely in Julia -- is needed for modern machine learning, AI, and graph analysis.\r\n\r\nThis modern knowledge graph database demands combining innovations from the database and programming languages communities.\r\n\r\nWe meet these demanding requirements by relying on Julia's powerful features. We present an overview of our usage of Julia and highlight our experience, in particular: the ability to specialize abstractions to highly efficient code, modularity through multiple-dispatch, and composable multithreading.\r\n\r\nWe discuss key database innovations that we support with this, such as: incrementally maintained views, recursive queries, database extensibility, semantic query optimization, and worst-case optimal join algorithms.\r\n\r\nWe focus on:\r\n\r\nQuery compilation:  We show how Julia makes maintaining a query compiler easier compared to statically compiled languages. New data types can be introduced modularly. We show benchmarks of our Julia-based query compiler vs a state-of-the-art database system. \r\n\r\nEfficient Data structures:  We summarize how Julia is surprisingly suitable for low-level data structures with the excessive performance needs of databases. Before Julia, this prohibited the option of implementing database systems in high-level languages.  We share our productive experience implementing a state-of-the-art write-optimized data structure.  We show how we leverage Julia's bias and optimizations for immutable data structures.\r\n\r\nParallel Query Evaluation: We share experience introducing composable multithreading in our codebase with limited refactoring. We benchmark effectiveness on many-core cloud instances.\r\n\r\nFront-end Compiler:  Julia supports generic traversals over abstract syntax trees. Pattern matching supports concise and comprehensible expression of language semantics.\r\n\r\nSoftware development:  We share experience with building a 100K+ LOC system in a commercial team setting. We discuss guidelines we use to support such a project.",

  "description": "The need for high precision calculations with 64bit floating-point numbers for weather and climate models has been questioned. Lower precision numbers can accelerate simulations and are increasingly supported by modern computing architecture. Posit numbers, a recently proposed alternative to floating-point numbers, claim to have smaller arithmetic rounding errors in many applications. As a standardized posit processor does not exist yet, we emulate posit arithmetic with SoftPosit.jl on a conventional processor. Julia’s type-flexibility easily allows to test benefits of posits compared to floats at 16bit in the Lorenz system and in ShallowWaters.jl. We show that forecasts based on posits are clearly more accurate than floats. Mixing 16 bit arithmetic with 32 bit for critical computations strongly reduces errors and is promising for present-day float-based hardware. Reduced precision communication of boundary values with 16 or 8-bit encoded as floats or posits introduces negligible errors, presenting a perspective for reduced data communication within a computer cluster.  Stochastic rounding modes, that are exact in expectation, are found to improve simulations at 16-bit and mimic uncertainties. Algorithmic bottlenecks with low precision are identified using Sherlogs.jl to facilitate the transition towards 16-bit arithmetic. We analyse algorithms form an information theory perspective to find the best number format for a given application. This approach led the the development of Sonums.jl, a number format that is optimal once trained on data to minimize the rounding error. The results promote the potential of 16-bit formats for at least parts of complex weather and climate models, where rounding errors would be entirely masked by intitial condition, model or discretization error.\r\n\r\nCo-authored by\r\n- Peter Dueben, ECMWF, Reading, UK\r\n- Tim Palmer, University of Oxford, UK",

  "description": "As the use of computing in science grows, more scientists are running ever larger computations. However, while the importance and use of a lab notebook is taught in many science degrees, the corresponding best practices for computer use often are not. From personal experience, I can tell that this leads to a growing number of random scripts and result files that after a week can’t be matched anymore. Alternatively, the code is sent to a server, and after requiring some small tweaks, the local and the remote version look different. A google search shows that this is not an uncommon problem, and there is an increasing number of blogs and papers addressing various aspects.  \r\n\r\nIn general, there are three aspect to a numerical result: the parameters, the code, and the environment. Specifically in Julia, the first two can be addressed by the combination of DrWatson.jl and Git, which makes it very easy to store the parameters used and the git hash of the commit with the code. This also includes the Manifest file, meaning that one can recreate the exact package environment, which is a major feature of Julia. However, this does not cover the binaries used by many packages. Examples include an NLopt algorithm throwing a segfault only on a specific version of Ubuntu, or a binary that only on Mac clashes with MKL.  \r\n\r\nOn the surface, containerization is the solution to these problems, but in practice the group doing the science and the group understanding containers seem mostly disjunct. After being in the first group until a few months ago, I now would like to present my approach and the small package [1] I wrote to facilitate it. It uses the scientific container software Singularity, which is less popular but more specialized than the widely known Docker (like Julia compared to Python). Differing from Docker, Singularity containers support various HPC hardware and software, do not require root to run, and integrate well into resource managers like SLURM. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I would like to introduce my workflow based on DrWatson.jl and my own measures to create very minimal containers that enable results that are fully reproducible on any machine with the Singularity runtime. This will include general aspects about Singularity and specific one related to incorporating Julia.  \r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/Crown421/Singularity.jl",

  "description": "The curriculum in general and undergraduate curriculum, in particular, is one of the most important pillars of an education system. The undergraduate curriculum has two main objectives i.e. employability and higher education. The greatest challenge in designing an undergraduate curriculum is achieving a balance between employability skills and laying the foundation for higher education. Generally, the curriculum is the combination of core technical subjects, professional electives, humanities, and skill-oriented subjects. We used natural language processing and machine learning packages in Julia to build a curriculum design system.\r\nThe steps to build a curriculum design system are described below:\r\n1.\tThe dataset was built from the job profiles from different job listing websites like indeed.com, linkedin.com, and monster.com. Also from the syllabus of competitive exams and qualifying exams for higher education.\r\n2.\tOn the dataset, we applied natural language processing techniques to identify the subjects and subject content. For natural language processing, we used TextAnalysis.jl package in Julia.\r\n3.\tTo generate syllabus content for a particular subject, a pointer-generator network was used. The pointer generator network is a text summarization technique that combines extractive and abstractive summarization techniques. The extractive summarization technique extracts keywords from the dataset, whereas the abstractive summarization technique generates new text from the existing text. The pointer-generator network was implemented using the MLJ.jl machine learning package in Julia. \r\n4.\tThe generated curriculum was then compared with the existing curriculum to get insights like, how much percent of the curriculum is industry oriented, how much percent of the curriculum is aimed at higher education, and job-oriented skills. \r\n5.\tThe above steps can be repeated with modified parameters to get better insights and curriculum. This also gives us an idea of how we can have an evolving curriculum that can help us bridge the gap between industry and academia.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, attendees will learn about natural language processing techniques using Julia and how it can be combined with machine learning to generate new knowledge from the existing knowledge.",

  "description": "The probabilistic optimization of dynamical systems is often framed to minimize the expectation of a given loss function. For non-linear systems, the evaluation of such a loss function and its gradient can be expensive. Often times practitioners rely on implicit methods, such a Monte Carlo simulation, for this calculation due to ease of implementation and understanding. Alternatively, explicit methods such as the Frobenious-Perron Operator can be leveraged to directly evolve probability densities through non-linear systems. Furthermore, the adjoint to the Frobenious-Perron Operator, the Koopman Operator, can be leveraged to the same ends. In this work we will demonstrate how the adjoint property of the Koopman Operator provides significant computational advantages over alternative methods for calculating expectations. We also demonstrate how this Koopman-based approach is AD-compatible. Building on Julia's differential equation ecosystem, this Koopman-based approach is available in [DiffEqUncertainty.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqUncertainty.jl)",

  "description": "When Julia finishes a computation and obtains a value the user is presented with the result. In the Julia REPL the result is usually represented as plain text. In other environments, such as in a Jupyter notebook, you sometimes see more rich representations, for example some values display as HTML, and others as images.\r\n\r\nThe main functions responsible for output in Julia are `display` and `show`. Usually `display` is the first method to be called when an object is presented to the user. The `display` function is implemented by displays such as the Julia REPL, the IDE or the notebook interface. Next, `display` requests output from `show` with a specific so-called MIME-type. Which MIME-types that are requested depends on what output the display is able to present back to the user. For example, the REPL mostly works with the `text/plain` MIME-type, and the notebook display supports multiple additional MIME-types, for example `image/png` for image output, `text/html` for HTML output, and so on. Given this rough overview the display system might seem rather simple, but there are many hidden complexities.\r\n\r\nIn order to take advantage of the rich display system and implement \"pretty printing\" for a custom type it is generally enough to implement methods of `show` with specific MIME-types. All types get a default text representation, but this can easily be overridden by implementing `show` with the `text/plain` MIME type. If the type can be represented in richer formats it is simple to add additional methods. For example, in order to support image output in a notebook it is enough to implement `show` with the `image/png` MIME type.\r\n\r\nThis talk will present how Julia's display system works and go through the process of taking an output object and generating output to present the user with. The talk will also examplify this process by discussing how to customize the output for your own types.",

  "description": "Julia's package ecosystem makes it fairly easy for private organizations to redistribute code back to the Julia community, and we've found there are numerous benefits to routinely open-sourcing internally developed packages:\r\n\r\n- great for recruiting both community collaborators and future FTEs\r\n- encourages well-scoped, composable APIs and discourages overcoupling of orthogonal functionality\r\n- encourages structuring/maintaining the project in a manner that keeps the contribution/collaboration barrier low\r\n- positively contributes to the health/growth of the Julia ecosystem that we all rely on; a more robust/featureful ecosystem attracts more great community members and improves productivity for existing community members.\r\n\r\nHowever, it can be difficult to implement effective internal practices that enable internal code to smoothly transition into high quality, open-source contributions. In this BoF, we'll swap techniques for maximizing open-source impact in the Julia ecosystem while minimizing refactor time/effort and code churn. Discussion points include:\r\n\r\n- developing Julia packages with upfront \"intent to open-source\"\r\n- the benefits/challenges of piecemeal upstreaming to existing packages\r\n- identifying/mitigating common pain points w.r.t. internal code churn\r\n- managing internal dependency graphs when nodes are open-sourced\r\n- the interplay between private CI/CD and open CI/CD for Julia packages\r\n- git history/metadata preservation\r\n- the role of GitHub in the Julia community, and open-sourcing non-GitHub-hosted projects\r\n- software licensing",

  "description": "Computing the dot product of two vectors and, perhaps to a lesser extent, summing the elements of a vector, are two very common basic building blocks for more complex linear algebra algorithms. As such, any change in their performance is likely to affect the overall performance of scientific computing codes; any change in their accuracy is likely to induce a loss of reproducibility in overall computed results. However, both the performance and accuracy of these algorithms is affected by the use of Floating-Point (FP) arithmetic: on the one hand, using smaller FP numbers tends to increase the performance of the computation (through increased memory bandwidth and wider SIMD registers). On the other hand, decreasing the precision of FP numbers also tends to decrease the accuracy if the results.\r\n\r\nThe work presented in this talk tries to address this issue by efficiently implementing [accurate summation and dot product algorithms in Julia](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02265534). These implementations are available under an open source license in the [AccurateArithmetic.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/AccurateArithmetic.jl) package, and aim at high performance by leveraging the SIMD capabilities of modern hardware (esp. AVX-2 & AVX-512). Besides naive algorithms, compensated algorithms are implemented: the Kahan-Babuška-Neumaier summation algorithm, and the [Ogita-Rump-Oishi](http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/030601818) simply compensated summation and dot product algorithms. These algorithms effectively double the working precision, producing much more accurate results while incurring little to no overhead, especially for large input vectors.\r\n\r\nThis talk also tries to build upon this example to make a case for a more widespread use of Julia in the HPC community. Although the vectorization of compensated algorithms is no particularly simple task, Julia makes it relatively easy and straightforward, particularly thanks to existing building blocks in the eco-system such as [SIMDPirates.jl](https://github.com/chriselrod/SIMDPirates.jl). Relying on generic functions and multiple dispatch also allows structuring the code in small, composable building blocks, closely matching textbook algorithms yet efficiently compiled.",

  "description": "We will give an overview of what the Julia package StateSpaceEcon can do and how it works internally.\r\n\r\nMacroeconomics typically deals with discrete-time systems of non-linear equations that include expectations of future values of the variables. One way to solve for these expectations is the “rational expectations” hypothesis which posits that expectations should be consistent with the whole system.\r\n\r\nThe package StateSpaceEcon solves these kinds of systems using a stacked-time algorithm. This algorithm builds one large system of equations over all time periods and solves it using a root-finding algorithm such as Newton-Raphson. This approach works very well for large discrete-time systems of non-linear equations simulated with anticipated shocks. When shocks are anticipated, the expectation about the future values of the variables and their realisations are equal.\r\n\r\nBesides, the StateSpaceEcon package offer functionalities that facilitate working with state space systems in the context of macroeconomic policy analysis.\r\n1. The package dependency TimeSeries supports time series at low frequencies (e.g. integer, monthly, quarterly and yearly). Vectorized operations, indexing and assignments greatly facilitate data manipulations.\r\n2. A plan object allows to perfectly control which variables and shocks are endogenous (i.e. determined by the system) or exogenous (imposed on the system externally), which might change from one time period to the next.\r\n3. On top of anticipated shocks, the package can handle unanticipated shocks. In this case, the expectations and their realizations will differ.\r\n4. The rational expectations solver computes the Jacobian of the system using automatic differentiation. It uses sparse matrices throughout in order to handle the very large, but very sparse, Jacobian resulting from the stacked-time algorithm.\r\n5. The steady state of the system can be computed and analysed using QR decomposition to report states that are left undetermined. Functionalities allow for adding steady state equations and assumptions, in order to close the steady state system.\r\n6. Finally, the package StateSpaceEcon can linearize the system around the steady state or any other solution and use the linearized system for simulations.",

  "description": "Convex.jl is a modelling language for solving convex optimization problems. This is a class of problem that, when modelled correctly, can be efficiently and accurately solved to global optimality. Convex.jl provides a simple and convenient modelling language that transforms user-entered problems into a structured form which, via the intermediary layer MathOptInterface.jl, is passed to solvers which can then exploit the structure to efficiently solve the problem.\r\n\r\nWe will discuss Convex.jl’s recent update from using the deprecated MathProgBase as an intermediary layer to instead using the actively developed MathOptInterface (which also powers JuMP). Among other things, this enables Convex.jl to formulate problems specified using generic numeric types and send problems to high-precision solvers in order to accurately calculate optimal values of optimization problems to many decimal places. We will also see how to build domain-specific abstractions on top of Convex.jl to provide convenient interfaces for formulating problems in field-specific contexts by using custom variable types and a new feature that allows variables to carry around their own constraints.\r\n\r\nWe will also see some new tooling: a library of end-to-end tests for MathOptInterface-compatible optimization solvers, and infrastructure to run the tests in parallel on GitHub Actions and display the results on a convenient webpage. \r\n\r\nLastly, we will discuss plans for Convex.jl’s next steps, to make it more efficient and even easier to extend, and invite the audience to help build that future.",

When the model includes unknown parameters, some parameter estimation is needed as well. I'll describe how Julia is the right tool for every step in this process.\r\n\r\n`Inflation.jl` generates the symbolic PDEs with a **symbolic tensor manipulation engine** built on `SymPy.jl` and `sympy.tensor.tensor`. Then `DifferentialEquations.jl` and related parameter estimation routines solve the PDEs, having little trouble even with high-dimensional inflation models.\r\n\r\nThe presentation will be organized into the lessons I learned while developing the package, and what I think we can all learn and apply to our own scientific computing projects, in cosmology and other fields.",

  "description": "The widely applicable approach we present relies on the usage of a powerful **stencil-based iterative method** which enables to efficiently converge to the time-dependent implicit solution for strongly nonlinear problems. The method optimally suits both shared and distributed memory parallelism. \r\n\r\nThe **implementation approach** enables a straightforward development of a single Julia code that can be readily deployed on a single CPU thread or on thousands of GPUs/CPUs. We have instantiated the approach in the Julia packages `ParallelStencil` and `ImplicitGlobalGrid`. `ParallelStencil` empowers domain scientists to write architecture-agnostic high-level code for parallel high-performance stencil computations on GPUs and CPUs. `ParallelStencil` uses `CUDAnative` for computations on GPUs and `Base.Threads` for computations on CPUs. `ImplicitGlobalGrid` renders the distributed parallelization of stencil-based GPU and CPU applications on a regular (staggered) grid nearly trivial. `ImplicitGlobalGrid` relies on the Julia MPI wrapper, `MPI.jl`, to perform halo updates close to hardware limit and leverages CUDA-aware MPI for GPU applications. We have designed both `ParallelStencil` and `ImplicitGlobalGrid` for simplest possible usage by domain-scientists, rendering fast and interactive development of massively scalable high performance Multi-GPU applications readily accessible to them.\r\n\r\nWe conduct the **performance evaluation** with a simple metric for iterative PDE solvers. The metric measures effective memory throughput and is complementary to traditional metrics.\r\n\r\nWe demonstrate the broad applicability of our approach **showcasing multiple 2-D and 3-D Multi-GPU PDE solvers**, as, for instance, a solver for spontaneous nonlinear multi-physics porous flow localization in 3-D. As reference, we ported the latter solver from MPI+CUDA C to Julia and it achieves 95% of the performance of the original solver and a nearly ideal parallel efficiency on thousands of NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs on the Piz Daint supercomputer at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, CSCS. We evaluate the presented solvers' performance and scalability on Piz Daint. The majority of the presented solvers are being made publicly available as part of the documentation of the packages `ParallelStencil` and `ImplicitGlobalGrid`.\r\n\r\nCo-authors: Ludovic Räss¹ ², Grzegorz Kwasniewski¹, Benjamin Malvoisin³, Yury Podladchikov³\r\n\r\n¹ ETH Zurich | ² Stanford University | ³ University of Lausanne",

  "description": "I will present on new features of DSGE.jl. Tentatively, they will be DSGEVARs and HMC.\r\n\r\nDynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models are workhorse tools at central banks. DSGEVAR methods allow economists to assess misspecification of DSGEs by comparing them to atheoretic vector autoregressions (VAR). The idea is to use DSGEs as priors for VARs in a Bayesian framework. These priors can be implemented by creating pseudo-data from a DSGE. The weight on the prior is determined by a hyperparameter. Larger values of the hyperparameter imply stronger belief that the DSGE explains the data. By finding the hyperparameter which maximizes the marginal data density of a DSGEVAR, we can evaluate misspecification relative to VARs. We build a simple user interface for DSGEVARs on top of DSGE.jl’s modeling approach, allowing users to easily estimate DSGEVARs and apply them in economic analysis.\r\n\r\nHamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) improves sampling efficiency during estimation of DSGEs because DSGEs have large sets of parameters. MCMC methods face a trade-off between exploring the parameter space and sampling from high-probability regions. This trade-off worsens in high dimensions. By using information from the gradient of the likelihood, HMC handles this trade-off better than other algorithms like Metropolis-Hastings. Applying HMC to DSGEs is difficult, however, because DSGEs have complex likelihood functions. Autodifferentiation is not immediately possible since calls to LAPACK are made during the likelihood calculation. We use the implicit function theorem to avoid calling LAPACK, which allows us to apply ForwardDiff.jl’s autodifferentiation for fast, accurate, and user-friendly gradient computation. We then write wrappers for the likelihood function and gradient to make it compatible with DynamicHMC.jl’s interface.\r\n \r\nDepending on research progress, I may also discuss tools to estimate nonlinear models. Unless Monte Carlo methods like particle filters are applied, it is difficult to compute the likelihoods of nonlinear models. Parallelization is required to effectively use these methods, but for most computing environments, this restriction forces users to use sequential Bayesian estimation algorithms, which are slow. In Julia, however, we can run nested parallel for loops. We combine SMC.jl’s Sequential Monte Carlo estimation algorithm with StateSpaceRoutines.jl’s Tempered Particle Filter to perform a “double-parallel” estimation of nonlinear economic models.",

This step has a problem i.e.; the moment you take out the documents from the safe they become vulnerable to illegal entities.

  "description": "The \"scripting workflow\", i.e. starting Julia, execute a code snippet, and then exit, is often not the recommended method for Julia code. One reason for this is that Julia is a just-in-time (JIT) compiled language, and the first call to a function is usually a lot slower than subsequent calls due to compilation. In a setting such as scripting there might only be one call to a function before exiting Julia. Spending time compiling the function might not be worth it in such a case, unless the faster runtime makes up for it. A simple example is a script that defines a single function, calls it, and then exits.\r\n\r\nThe recommended Julia workflow is instead to keep a single Julia session alive for as long as possible, and reuse it for multiple tasks. Even though two tasks A and B are not be directly related, they may both use, for example, arrays. Thus, after performing task A we have already compiled some array methods, and task B will benefit from that, with reduced compilation time as the result. This interaction is something that scripting can not take advantage of, since compiled methods are forgotten when exiting Julia.\r\n\r\nThe problems presented above have two obvious possible solutions: (i) spend less time compiling and (ii) store compiled methods and make them available in future sessions. For the first option we can use Julias interpreter and only compile whats necessary. This is often a great solution for very short-running tasks, and requires nothing extra, just some command line flags to Julia. The second option is a bit more involved (although nowadays pretty easy using the PackageCompiler.jl package), however, it can completely elimitate runtime compilation. The downside is that the compiled and cached methods live in a separate file that needs to be bundled with the script.\r\n\r\nThis talk will discuss how Julia can be used for scripting, present some tips and tricks on how to make scripting more viable, and show some succesful examples of the two solutions presented above.",

  "description": "SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) is a term for when the processor executes the same operation (like addition) on multiple numbers (data) in one instruction. Recent processor architectures come with the capability of running these SIMD instructions on even larger batches of data, making it more important to make sure that SIMD is used when possible, for best performance.\r\n\r\nFortunately, in many cases, Julia can automatically make code use SIMD. Often this comes from optimizations made by LLVM, the code generation library Julia uses. Some cases of this are in:\r\n\r\n- Loops, where the LLVM Loop Vectorizer can identify patterns where the loop can be unrolled so that multiple iterations can be done When there is a reduction involved, like when summing the elements of an array, the `@simd` macro might be needed.\r\n- Different patterns of scalar operations that can be combined into one SIMD instructions, like when adding two tuples. This is vectorized by the LLVM SLP (Superword-Level Parallelism) vectorizer.\r\n\r\nThere are however cases where auto-vectorization like above doesn’t happen. This can be when LLVM does not recognize the opportunity to use SIMD or when it isn’t valid to do so because it could change the result slightly. In cases like this, it is possible to:\r\n\r\n- Use a “SIMD vector library” like SIMD.jl. This allows one to create a “SIMD Vector” that works similarly to a number but operations on it will work elementwise using SIMD instructions.\r\n- Explicitly call machine instructions specific for a certain CPU architecture. This gives the most control but has the drawback of tying the code the CPU architecture, making it less generic. \r\n\r\nThis talk will show discuss and show examples of the above SIMD cases, giving insight into how to leverage SIMD for greater performance.",

We start off with some generic tutorials about compiling a very simple shared library and using that directly from Julia using `ccall`, and then build up more complex cases using CxxWrap to tackle proper C++ constructs such as classes and templates. Exercises are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Shared libraries: build and use `libfoo` from the BinaryBuilder tests, using CMake. This will gently introduce everyone to the manual compilation of a shared library, which is required for package development with CxxWrap.\r\n2. Setting up CxxWrap for development: Compile CxxWrap itself using your system compiler and set it up using Overrides.toml. This is needed on most platforms, since the distributed CxxWrap binaries are cross-compiled and usually incompatible with the installed compiler.\r\n3. Make a CxxWrap wrapper package for `libfoo`\r\n4. Wrapping the [Eigen C++ matrix library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)\r\n5. Smart pointers\r\n6. Using and extending the STL support\r\n7.

  "description": "Over the past two years at the University of Michigan, we have successfully taught computational data science and machine learning using Julia to over a thousand graduate students, spanning over 80 disciplines. We've scaled to support 275 enrolled students (Fall 2019) and expect to scale to over 500 in the very near future. The course is taught in a hybrid lecture-lab style which presents students with the opportunity to experience hands-on, interactive, inquiry-based learning. Student feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We will present a hands-on demo, featuring selected content from the course, and invite the audience to experience it for themselves.\r\n\r\nWe will present our vision for an interactive computational textbook platform designed to stimulate deeper conversations between students and the material that they are attempting to master. The primary technique used to facilitate this deeper engagement is the punctuation of instructional content (such as motivation, math fundamentals, theorems, proofs, etc.) with short, self-contained exercises that are designed to allow the student to constantly check their understanding. Exercises include conceptual questions to check comprehension of the underlying content, auto-graded programming assignments to practice the ability to put ideas into practice as code, and free-response prompts to allow the student to make their own observations and draw the appropriate conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this constant \"self-checking\" is two-fold. First, students are forced to more rigorously develop foundational knowledge before moving on to more advanced topics. This sets students up for success when the more advanced content is presented and avoids the dreaded \"content paralysis\" phenomenon where students are overwhelmed by the sheer scope of content on first glance (this usually manifests itself as a student blindly running code in “run-all mode\" in an attempt to produce the desired results instead of actually understanding what they are doing). Second, this framework allows an author to more carefully design content to encourage a guided learning experience. The author can design a narrative, complete with exposition (what is this algorithm?), conflict (when does it fail?), and resolution (how can we fix it?). Our demo will allow you to experience how much more immersive “living” computational textbooks written in this way can be.",

  "description": "(Conditional) Neural Processes ((C)NPs) [^1] [^2] are a rich class of models that parametrise the predictive distribution through an encoding of the observed data. Their flexibility allows them to be deployed in a myriad of applications, such as image completion and generation, time series modelling, and spatio-temporal applications. Neural Processes have enjoyed much interest recently, resulting in the development of several well-performing members of the Neural Process family. As an effort to accelerate the development and evaluation of NP architectures, we present NeuralProcesses.jl [^3], a framework for NPs built on top of Flux.jl. NeuralProcesses.jl provides basic building blocks that can be flexibly composed and mixed and matched to reconstruct many (conditional) neural process architectures from the literature, as well as expand to novel architectures.\r\n\r\nA recently introduced new member of the neural process family, called the Convolutional Conditional Neural Process (ConvCNP) [^4], proposes to account for _translation equivariance_ in the data: if the observations are shifted, then the predictions should be shifted accordingly. Translation equivariance is an important inductive bias for many learning problems, such as time series, spatial data, and images. The ConvCNP has been demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art performance on several established NP benchmarks.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we give a brief introduction to meta-learning, the neural process family, and NeuralProcesses.jl. To demonstrate the abstractions of NeuralProcess.jl, we walk through an implementation of the ConvCNP. We will then use the ConvCNP to predict a sawtooth wave, an otherwise challenging task due to the wave's discontinuous nature. We conclude with a brief demonstration of how the building blocks of NeuralProcess.jl can be used to construct several prominent NP architectures.\r\n\r\n[^1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01613\r\n\r\n[^2] https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01622\r\n\r\n[^3] https://github.com/wesselb/NeuralProcesses.jl\r\n\r\n[^4] https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skey4eBYPS",

  "description": "R and Julia are two languages that complement each other very well: R has many convenient features from a huge number of packages. Julia brings new possibilities for writing fast code and offers new and innovative packages. Integrating functionality of Julia in R is especially promising due to the many commonalities of Julia and R. We take advantage of these in the design of our \"JuliaConnectoR\" R package (https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/JuliaConnectoR), which aims at a tight and stable integration of Julia in R.\r\n\r\nThe JuliaConnectoR can import Julia functions, also from whole packages, and make them directly callable in R. Values and data structures are translated between the two languages. Julia objects can be fully translated to R objects or accessed via proxy object that behave like R objects. In addition to directly using features from Julia packages, this also greatly simplifies writing own Julia code for optimizing time critical portions of R code compared to writing C extensions in R.\r\n\r\nThe possibility to pass R functions as arguments to Julia functions makes the JuliaConnectoR a truly functional interface. Such callback functions can, e. g., be used to interactively display the learning process of a neural network in R while it is trained in Julia. This sets the JuliaConnectoR apart from the other R packages for integrating Julia in R, “XRJulia” and “JuliaCall”. Additionally, the JuliaConnectoR offers features that make the interactive use more convenient and stable, such as the redirection of standard (error) output and the ability to interrupt running calls to Julia. These unique features become possible with an optimized communication protocol, based on TCP, which also allows a highly efficient data transfer by leveraging the similarities in the binary representation of values in Julia and R.\r\n\r\nWe show the implementation of the package and demonstrate the features of the JuliaConnectoR with several examples, including deep learning with the Julia package “Flux” in R and analysing large datasets via “JuliaDB”.",

  "description": "The new package manager, `Pkg`, that comes with Julia 1.0 had many improvements over the previous one. However, just because Julia 1.0 was released, did not mean that the work on Pkg stopped. The biggest feature that has landed is the [Artifact system](https://julialang.org/blog/2019/11/artifacts/) which got added in 1.3. There are however also some other, smaller features that might have gone under the radar, for example:\r\n\r\n- New resolver strategy to reduce the number of resolver errors when adding packages but also reduce the number of unnecessary updates to packages when adding a package.\r\n- Built-in support for managing registries.\r\n- Argument passing to the test process\r\n- Support for instantiating a manifest without a corresponding project file.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are some exciting features that are in development some of which are listed below:\r\n\r\n- Offline mode (aka airplane mode) allows one to develop packages in a convenient manner even while being offline.\r\n- Community driven hosting of packages and artifacts allows for package authors to see e.g. download stats for their packages.\r\n- Multiple packages in one repo.\r\n\r\nThis talk will summarize the new features of `Pkg` since 1.0 and also give an overview of plans and work in progress for future `Pkg` releases.",

I present a new ice thickness estimation model [1,2] based on a mass-conserving forward model and a Bayesian inversion scheme (BITE.jl code on github [3]).  The model assimilates observations of ice thickness and speed using a Bayesian scheme implemented with a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, which calculates estimates of ice thickness and their error. The model is validated using 733 glaciers from four regions of the world with ice thickness measurements, and it is demonstrated that the model can be used for large-scale studies by fitting it to over 30,000 glaciers from around the globe.

  "description": "The Julia package VisualStringDistances.jl provides several notions of distance between two strings based on how they are rendered by GNU Unifont; e.g., capital-eye (“I”) and lowercase-ell (“l”) are close together, while “a” and e.g. “X” are far apart, even though they are both one character apart. By comparing strings visually, this package provides a means for quantifying how easily two strings might be confused when read by a human.\r\n\r\nThis measure of distance is calculated by the means of “unbalanced optimal transport” via the package UnbalancedOptimalTransport.jl which will also be discussed. Loosely speaking, this measures the cost of moving “mass” (i.e. black pixels in the printed representation of a string) from one place to another in order to transform the printed representation of one string into another, allowing the destruction or creation of mass (with some cost). This will be illustrated visually in the talk to provide an understanding of this interesting technique that has been applied to a variety of fields (image registration, economics, traffic flows, etc).\r\n\r\nThe motivating application of VisualStringDistances.jl is for establishing automated checks for Julia’s General registry of packages in order to flag new packages for manual review. A malicious agent might try to register a package with a name that looks very similar to the name of some popular package, and then suggest users use it in online postings or tutorials. A user who copy-pastes the name or code that adds the package might not realize the name is different from that of the popular package. To aid in preventing this scenario, an automated check can be added to the General registry in order to prevent automated merging of new packages whose names look similar to those of existing packages.\r\n\r\nA related task is that of measuring “typo-similarity” to prevent automerging of packages who names are likely to be entered by mistake when typing the name of another package. This will be discussed as well, time permitting.",

  "description": "[Slides](https://raw.githack.com/oxinabox/ChainRulesJuliaCon2020/main/out/build/index.html)\r\n\r\nA perhaps counterintuitive requirement for differentiable programming is easy hand-coded rules for determining derivatives. You might think: “I thought the whole point of differentiable programming was to use AD, so I didn’t have to write all these derivatives by hand.”. Indeed you don’t have to, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn't be allowed to, and it doesn’t mean you can't get advantages out of doing do. Custom sensitivities allow programmers to insert domain knowledge that no autodiff system could ever figure out. Further custom rules, let you work around any bugs in the AD system, and fix performance issues.\r\nSo being able to write custom rules is important, and doing it once for every AD system is win on deduplicating effort.\r\n\r\nA secondary advantage of ChainRules is that it provides a set of differential types to be used by AD systems. The differential types provided by ChainRules are very expressive, more expressive in-fact than is required for any current AD system. These types allow ChainRules to act as a lingua franca between AD systems. If it is advantageous because of some properties of your system to AD one part with ForwardDiff2 (via forward-mode), another part with Zygote (via source code transformation reverse mode) and another via Nabla (via overloading tape-based reverse mode) then you can; and each part can understand the derivative types returned by the other.\r\n\r\nThe ChainRules project has 3 packages:\r\n - ChainRulesCore.jl: the minimum stuff required to implement custom rules for your package. Think of it like RecipesBase for Plots.jl. It should be used by all packages wanting to support rules.\r\n - ChainRules.jl: a repository of rules for functions defined in Base and the Standard Libraries. This was separated out from ChainRulesCore to minimize load time. It should be used by AD packages wanting to consume rules.\r\n - ChainRulesTestUtils.jl: robust testing utilities based on finite differencing. Its a test-time dependency for packages defining rules.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover:\r\n - An introduction to AD, including terminology such as pullback, custom sensitivity etc.\r\n - The details the use and design of the ChainRules packages\r\n - An explanation of some of the open questions in autodiff and our resolutions to them including: natural vs structural derivatives, mutating reverse-mode AD, chunked AD / change of basis, one-to-one vs many-to-many relationships between differential and primal types.",

We will show how well it plays with Julia’s existing state-of-the-art packages enabling more kinds of modelling than ever, and show how the community is taking advantage of it.\r\n\r\nWe will also showcase Flux’s new APIs and features that open up the awesome open-source community to express more complex ideas and bring domain skills into their ML stories. We will show how we’ve worked on improving performance through a myriad changes across the ecosystem, while keeping it easy to use as ever.\r\n\r\nWe would also discuss the design patterns that enable users to write elegant and performant Julian code that can best take advantage of the powerful automatic differentiation capabilities that we have built over time.",

  "description": "We will give an overview [NamedDims.jl](https://github.com/invenia/NamedDims.jl), which allows you to name array dimensions and use intuitive syntax when working with arrays.  For example, letting you fetch the first timestamp with `data[time=1]`, or sum data over time with `sum(data, dims=:time)`.\r\n\r\nWe will focus on showing example where NamedDims helps solve practical problems that appear often in scientific programming.\r\n\r\nFor example, NamedDims.jl makes array operation safer by requiring dimensions to be compatible, so you don’t accidentally e.g. add `time` values to `places` values, and gives an informative error message if you try to.\r\n\r\nAnd by being a zero-cost abstraction, package developers can use NamedDims to make their code safer internally, without requiring users adopt NamedDims. For example,  taking any `AbstractArray` as input and giving the dimensions names internally with no performance hit. \r\n\r\nAnd if users do pass in `NamedDimsArray`, package developers can choose to use that information. For example this opens up the possibility of knowing which dimensions of the data stores “observations”, and allows dealing with data in any orientation.\r\n\r\nNamedDims.jl composes well with other packages, so you can use can pass `NamedDimsArray`s to your favourite machine learning package, have it train on a GPU using your favourite autodiff package, and expect everything to work the same as a plain, unnamed array. And if you pass `NamedDimsArray`s through FFTs you may even get cute `∿`s added to the names of the result!",

  "description": "In this study, we consider a canonical fragmentation problem in fluid mechanics: splash of a drop on a liquid layer. Although this phenomena occurs in the twinkling of an eye (20 - 30 ms), it is an exquisitely regulated phenomena. The splash is typically accompanied by the formation of a thin cylindrical liquid sheet rising upwards, which resembles a crown. The crown sheet dynamics is typically characterized by a coupled set of mass and momentum balance equations. The thickness of the sheet is of the order of microns. In addition, the crown sheet thickness is found to have a spatial and temporal dependence, making it a dynamically changing quantity and difficult to probe experimentally. The sheet thickness has only recently been experimentally measured and theoretically validated in prior studies.\r\n\r\nIn the present work, we use a neural architecture to approximate the sheet thickness profile and use it in combination with the crown mass and momentum balance equations. We show that the thickness profile predicted by the trained neural architecture matches well with the experimentally measured thickness profile. In addition, the trained neural network is also able to recover the spatial and temporal dependence of the thickness profile, which matches well with the theoretically derived dependencies. \r\n\r\nThis augmentation of scientific modeling with neural networks is thus shown to play a major role in speeding experimentally driven inquiries, especially when studying dynamically varying quantities which are difficult to measure; such as the sheet thickness in this system. In addition, such augmentation paves way to make neural architectures more interpretable even when working with small datasets.",

  "description": "GigaSOM is an implementation of the Self-Organizing-Maps algorithm by Kohonen that facilitates  the clustering and dimension reduction of huge-scale datasets, counting billions of individual data points with tens of dimensions. Its development, showcased at the 2019 JuliaCon conference, is motivated by the needs of flow and mass cytometry data analysis, relevant in immunology, developmental biology and clinical medicine: Individual cells from the measurements need to be precisely categorized (which is currently best done by the self-organizing maps as devised by van Gassen et al. (2015)), and eventually evaluated and visualized.\r\n\r\nGigaSOM is able to perform this precise kind of computation on large compute clusters, and facilitates the analysis to scale horizontally. We will describe a Julia toolkit for map-reduce-style computation and data distribution in the common HPC environments, which we developed for the purposes of GigaSOM. The toolkit cooperates with the Distributed package, and works well within common cluster software, e.g. Slurm. With that in hand, we demonstrate high-level implementation of SOMs and related algorithms (e.g. EmbedSOM (Kratochvíl et al., 2019)) that scale horizontally, show measurements of the performance, and demonstrate the results achievable on several datasets, including the data from International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (Brown & Moore, 2012). Notably, our testing showed that 1 billion data points can be processed within only minutes using relatively common computer clusters or cloud compute grids, which vastly expands the possibilities of large-scale data analysis.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the software package is assured using ARTENOLIS (https://artenolis.lcsb.uni.lu) (Heirendt et al., 2017). Biological validation of the results is performed by comparison to conventional implementations of the FlowSOM package and manual analysis.",

  "description": "The reactive programming (RP) paradigm is becoming increasingly popular. RP combines concepts from asynchronous data processing and the observer design pattern. Common applications are online data processing, interactive visualization and responsive user interfacing. The implementation of RP within a reactive framework allows developers to conveniently define relationships between data producers and consumers, and enables developers to build distributed and scalable applications more efficiently. Popular reactive frameworks in languages other than Julia include RxPy, RxJS, RxCpp and RxJava. \r\n\r\nIn areas such as machine learning, reinforcement learning and signal processing, data often arrive asynchronously and at different time scales. In this context, to reduce the developer's effort, RP offers a set of operators for composing, merging, filtering and transforming asynchronous data streams and provides a versatile API for listening for changes in these data streams. \r\n\r\nIn order to support RP in Julia, we have developed Rocket.jl, which is an efficient and flexible reactive extensions package, written in pure Julia. \r\n\r\nEfficiency is achieved by relying on Julia's type system and advanced optimisation techniques. Rocket.jl introduces additional abstractions that can largely be evaluated and in-lined at compile time, resulting in an efficient implementation of RP with almost zero overhead compared to traditional imperative programs. Comparative performance benchmarks are available on the GitHub repository.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, flexibility is maintained by making use of Julia's multiple dispatch system. A user can readily extend built-in functionality with additional operators and custom observables. The self-contained documentation of Rocket.jl provides a convenient introduction to RP, and offers a collection of examples and use cases that illustrates how users can customize the built-in functionality to their needs.\r\n\r\nWe compared Rocket.jl with two other Julia implementations of the RP, and applied the basic map and filter operators to an asynchronous data stream. In terms of computation time, Rocket.jl outperforms Signals.jl and Reactive.jl on average by a factor of 2 and 4, respectively. Memory usage is similar across these packages. \r\n\r\nWe believe that usability is a key factor when applying the RP to practical problems. Therefore we designed Rocket.jl as a RP package that enables developers to build flexible and efficient reactive systems.",

  "description": "This talk tackles the main issue regarding the development of solutions for market risk management: given a financial contract, one must know how to price it, but it is also required to understand how the pricing formula reacts to changes in the market prices.\r\n\r\nThis project was heavily inspired by Julia Computing's [Miletus.jl](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/Miletus.jl), but goes one step further: given a financial contract, it is now possible to automatically map its risk factors. A general solution is based on [ForwardDiff.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl). Alternative methods can be included in the system by making use of Julia's multiple-dispatch.\r\n\r\nCompiler algorithms were used on top of Julia's [JIT compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) to generate pricing formulas. Using a customized [IR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation) defined in [OptimizingIR.jl](https://github.com/felipenoris/OptimizingIR.jl) it is possible to represent a pricing function that would require a billion nodes on an [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) with just a few thousand instructions in the optimized IR. With this setting, this solution provides:\r\n\r\n* Scalability: compile millions of pricing functions without breaking Julia.\r\n\r\n* Automated Auditing: automatically generate documentation on how the calculation is performed, as often required by market regulators and auditing firms.\r\n\r\n* Cashflow projection: given that functions are not restricted to return a single number, it is possible to compile pricing functions that also return intermediate results.\r\n\r\n* Take advantage of context: compile a whole portfolio to a single pricing function, and all repeated intermediate steps in the calculation are done only once, without losing detail on pricing results for each contract in the portfolio.",

  "description": "Whether you’re a scientist, a finance professional or an engineer, you use notebooks like Jupyter to tell a story. You fiddle a bit with your code, running cells here and there, and when you’re done - you restart the kernel and keep your fingers crossed that it’ll all work together when you press “run all”. \r\n\r\n🙋 **In Pluto, things work differently.** When you change a variable, Pluto automatically re-runs the cells that refer to it. And when you delete a cell, the variables, methods and imports from the old code disappear. Unlike Jupyter or Matlab, there is **no mutable workspace**, but rather a _one-to-one correspondence_ between variables and code. \r\n\r\n🚨 Reactivity is not just fun for mathematical tricks! It guarantees that the code you see exactly matches the variables you're working with, eliminating bugs before you even knew you had them. \r\n\r\n⚡ Your notebook becomes interactive by splitting your code into multiple cells! Changing one cell **instantly shows effects** on all other cells, giving you a fast and fun way to experiment with your model. And to really spice up your notebook, you can use HTML sliders, or even custom JavaScript widgets, to drive your Julia variables. Change `λ = 5` to `@bind λ Slider(1:10)`, and all cells that use `λ` are controlled by a slider.\r\n\r\n💾 Notebooks are **saved as pure Julia files** and can be exported as rich documents with cell output to HTML or PDF. By separating source code and output, you can take full advantage of git for version control and you can import Pluto notebooks as if they are written in a regular editor.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAfter a live demo, the second part of the talk will unveil some of the tricks that power Pluto. The core concepts are: \r\n- **_static code analysis_** to find global definitions and references in cells;\r\n- **_directed graph_** of cells, which tells Pluto which cells to run, in which order;\r\n- **_managed workspace_** for code to live in, and cleaning the workspace in milliseconds;\r\n- **_responsive connection_** between JavaScript clients and Julia.\r\n\r\nPluto is **written in pure Julia**, which comes with two benefits: first, it’s easily installable as a package without requiring Python - you only need Julia and a web browser. Second, it is ready to be improved by Julia developers who we hope to inspire at the conference. Pluto is an exciting project to work on, and we are eager to hear your ideas!\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl)",

  "description": "Neuroscience relies on the development of highly technical mathematical and computational techniques. These techniques are subsequently used and empirically validated and interpreted with the assistance of neuroscientists. This dynamic results in an additional step to the classic two-language problem, communication between fields that often have a very different knowledge base. Often this communication gap is managed by a common coding language. However, the increasing demand for incorporating multiple modalities and larger sample sizes into data analyses is incompatible with most languages used by neuroscientists (e.g., Matlab, R, Python). Consequently, neuroscientists are often using outdated techniques and those developing newer techniques struggle to reach broader adoption for empirically testing and improving their work. We will show how Julia can help solve the three-language problem through a common programmatic language and the interaction between generic code bases across different fields by introducing the [NeuroCore]( https://github.com/JuliaNeuroscience/NeuroCore.jl) package and related resources.\r\n\r\nWe will begin by providing a high-level overview of how NeuroCore provides a generic API and access to flexible types. We will provide examples illustrating how this design can be easily extended and incorporated by others.  We will then provide brief examples of current and planned uses of NeuroCore, including plotting, graph theory, file format access, and data wrangling.

  "description": "We present an overview of the program for the description and classification of molecular vibrations we have been developing using Julia, along with a systematic and highly effective method derived  from applied group theory.  This overview emphasizes the computational challenges that this real-time description  presents and  the  solutions offered by Julia.\r\n \r\n The description of molecular vibrations in real-time  implies a series of complex and  highly demanding  computational tasks that we have implemented in Julia :\r\n\r\n1) Given the coordinates of the atoms as input, we determine the point symmetry group of the molecule.  Extensive use of matrices and fast calculation of  eigenvectors and eigenvalues is a must.\r\n\r\n2) Once the point group is determined, we identify the symmetry operations using their matrix representations. Once again, we have relied on Julia's capabilities of matrix diagonalization, this time in the case of  asymmetric matrices with complex eigenvalues and eigenvectors. \r\n\r\n3) Finally we determine and classify the normal modes of vibration using a matrix representation of invariant subspaces that allow a complete classification of the vibrational modes. \r\n\r\nOnly we have to add that, knowledge of  the  molecular vibrational modes is a must in many scientific and technological applications. Its  importance is out of discussion.\r\n\r\nAlthough many programs have been developed, mainly in Fortran, most of them are highly sophisticated and depends upon expensive hardware resources.\r\n\r\nJulia offers the invaluable opportunity to develop a simple, reliable and low-cost resources program with high standard of quality that requires no more than a simple laptop.",

Included will be a discussion of why a microservice can be more general purpose and accessible than a script, and how one could move a script computation into the framework of a full microservice.\r\n\r\n* How does the rubber meet the road; step-by-step walk-through of building a simple Julia microservice; implementation of object model definitions and packages that help in customizing object representations; implementing web, service, and persistence layers and packages available to aid in layer-to-layer object transfer; how to run the service and writing a simple client to test; quick example of \"packaging\" the service as a docker container for maximum portability and flexibility\r\n\r\n* Advanced topics in building microservices; solutions to common problems like logging, context setting and management, middleware setup, authentication, caching, connection pooling, config management, threaded worker task execution, docker container considerations, and using PackageCompiler.\r\n\r\nEvery microservice is unique and will always require customization and tooling, but with a set of high quality swiss-army packages and best practices, more time can be focused on domain logic instead of service setup and tooling.",

The human interaction and mentoring is the core of Exercism, and the v3 curriculum is built around making these interactions as meaningful as possible.\r\n\r\nDuring the development of v3, we first identified concepts that make Julia unique and that users must know in order to reach “fluency” in the language. Then, we built bite-sized concept exercises that teach these concepts, ideally isolated from other concepts. These will be mentored automatically based on a normalization of the solution and community-sourced feedback. Solving these exercises unlocks practice exercises that can be used to deepen learned concepts and allow many different approaches whose merits can be discussed with a human mentor.\r\n\r\nWhile there are many great resources for learning Julia, information on how to create such resources is scarce. By sharing our experiences, challenges and learnings from creating v3, we hope to encourage others to create learning resources and share our approach to creating one. Additionally, we believe that the tooling, primarily the normalization of solutions, and the exercise pool can be of use to others teaching Julia.",

When packages are loaded, there is a precompilation step that takes place that tries to cache some of this work, but even with that the latency before the function actually runs can be significant.\r\n\r\nJulia comes with a few packages that are already installed and available without having to explicitly add them like normal packages. These are called “standard libraries” and the Julia REPL is one of them. You might have noticed that the Julia REPL loads almost instantly (significantly faster than a “normal” package) even though it is a quite complex package. This is because it is compiled into what is called a “sysimage” which allows more extensive caching of compiled code than the normal package precompilation system.\r\n\r\nPackageCompiler.jl (which recently had its 1.0 release) is a package that makes it easy to create custom sysimages which can include other packages than the default standard libraries. This can be used in cases where a commonly used package is slow to load or has functions with high overhead for the first call.\r\n\r\nIn addition, PackageCompiler.jl can create apps that can be downloaded and directly run on a machine that doesn’t have Julia installed. It works together with [the artifact system](https://julialang.org/blog/2019/11/artifacts/) allowing automatic bundling of external binaries and libraries. This allows one to ship quite sophisticated apps written in Julia in a simple manner.\r\n\r\nThis talk will expand on the points above and show the API of PackageCompiler.jl v1.0.",

  "description": "Dynamic simulations are important in the design and operation of power systems in order to ensure grid stability. Traditional simulation tools in research and industry mainly rely on time-domain simulations based on step-by-step numerical integration. The power system, however, has seen an increase in complexity in light of the current operation of large interconnected networks, growth in electricity demand, and the increasing integration of renewable energies. From the power system analysis perspective, the impact of these changes in operating conditions is an increase in computational complexity in the simulation tools applied for stability and control studies. Parallel and distributed computing techniques are frequently applied to improve the computational speed by taking advantage of multi-core processors and cluster computing. However, the analysis methods for time-domain simulations were developed for sequential operation and optimized for running on single-processors, thereby rendering their application for parallel solutions challenging.\r\n\r\nThis talk introduces a new Julia-based parallel simulation algorithm to address the need for efficient computation methods in power system stability analysis. The parallel algorithm achieves computational efficiency by adapting an inherently sequential power system numerical solution to a parallel solution using a parallel-in-space decomposition scheme and the Julia computing environment. This talk will describe the parallel-in-space technique which is applied to restructure the power system problem in such a way that it can be applied for formulation of a parallel algorithm. The in-space decomposition is based on the Block Bordered Diagonal Formulation (BBDF) to divide the network coefficient matrix into submatrices that can be solved in parallel. The talk will show how optimal balancing of tasks in the parallel solution process is achieved using a multi-level graph partitioning technique, which is extended to the dynamic simulation problem to obtain balanced subnetworks to be solved in parallel and only linked via an interconnect partition to share information at every time step.\r\n\r\nSimulation results will be presented using IEEE standard test networks of varying complexity. The results in the parallel simulation toolbox are compared to those obtained from a sequential implementation in order to validate the solution accuracy and to determine performance improvements in terms of computational speedup.",
