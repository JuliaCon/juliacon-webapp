The code, developed by a distributed team, will be made capable to run on CPU and GPU architectures.\r\n\r\nPreviously, during his Ph.D., Charles developed a liquid-metal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solver and framework for simulating liquid-metal MHD flows for fusion energy applications, in particular, for accident scenarios involving loss of plasma confinement, resulting in electromagnetic interactions between the plasma and liquid-metal breeding blanket.\r\n\r\nCharles has a passion for developing HPC software for simulating physical phenomena."

Some of teaching experiences I have done since high school until now.\r\n\r\nOne of my teaching experiences in 2020 is teaching using Julia programming language. Started from the thesis topic that I worked on in 2018 together with my lecturer, Mr. Henki W. Ashadi. The title is Steel Truss Design using Julia Programming Language. The results of the thesis that I made are, structural analysis calculations such as internal forces, deflection, to the determination of steel profiles, just by using packages that have been available in Julia and several function.\r\n\r\nMy thesis can be used for learning in civil engineering lectures, especially for the calculation of steel frame structures. Currently, as many as 38 students are designing various skeletal models using my thesis in Julia. And I'm proud, my work can be useful for others."
