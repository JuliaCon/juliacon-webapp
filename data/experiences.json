Dark matter has only gravitational interaction and can be easily simulated. However, what we observe are the galaxies. I translated from Python3 my code to populate dark matter simulation with galaxies in Julia. In a month, starting from no Julia experience, I obtained a speed up of about 10. Now I extensively use Julia in my work.","endTime":"2022-07-29T13:18:00"},{"videoCode":"4SokD3Om3kc","startTime":"2022-07-29T13:18:00","speakerIds":["BQF8LN"],"id":"8MGPAT","title":"Analyze Your Health and Fitness Data using Julia","abstract":"I wear a Samsung smartwatch, which has various sensors to record activities such as steps, distance, climbed floors and heart rate. The data recorded by these sensors can be downloaded in the form of CSV files. \r\n\r\nI was inspired to do a fun data science project, where I could explore various packages from the Julia ecosystem. I was easily able to create interactive visualizations, which provided a lot of insight on my daily health routines and how I could improve upon them.","endTime":"2022-07-29T13:21:00"},{"videoCode":"fmLJiiIuadE","startTime":"2022-07-29T13:21:00","speakerIds":["3EY8FS"],"id":"AUPPZY","title":"Agent-Based Modeling with Julia","abstract":"Julia is a promising and powerful language for agent-based modeling and it already has a fully functional agent-based modeling framework called Agents.jl. This framework is clearly faster than the other popular frameworks in use today, and also offers unique features that are difficult to replicate. At the same time, there are points of design and documentation that could still be improved, especially when it comes to addressing beginners.","endTime":"2022-07-29T13:24:00"},{"videoCode":"Sq1X_8L7Ej0","startTime":"2022-07-29T13:24:00","speakerIds":["BVRHH3"],"id":"GXCNEZ","title":"Visualizando dependencia probabil√≠stica con Pluto.jl","abstract":"La rapidez de Julia combinada con los notebooks reactivos de Pluto permiten ilustrar de forma interactiva la importancia de visualizar las pseudo-observaciones de la funci√≥n c√≥pula subyacente de un vector aleatorio, y c√≥mo los scatterplots de los datos originales pueden resultar enga√±osos.","endTime":"2022-07-29T13:27:00"},{"videoCode":"GAg38PYHzMg","startTime":"2022-07-29T13:27:00","speakerIds":["JFZQZ7"],"id":"JXBTJF","title":"Calibrating Pedestrian Models with Turing.jl","abstract":"Pedestrian models are used by practitioners to construct safer, more comfortable, and more efficient pedestrian environments.
