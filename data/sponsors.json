Today, Beacon leverages Julia to interrogate brain function at unprecedented throughput and accelerate the development of new treatments for neurological disease. \n\n Beacon's Platform enables population-level analyses that aggregate insights across hundreds of thousands of clinical EEGs, capturing the wide array of features that characterize the heterogeneity of brain function across a breadth of indications, setting a new data standard for neurobiomarker design. At this scale, traditional manual feature extraction methods become intractable due to cost, inter-rater variability, and the limited availability of trained experts. Beacon overcomes this bottleneck via an ever-growing suite of machine learning models that replicate the consensus interpretation of clinical experts and exceed human capabilities over thousands of hours of biosignal recordings. Our Platform equips customers with the ability to leverage Beacon's scalable brain health analytics throughout the lifecycle of drug discovery, development, and deployment.",
