        Discord is where all the discussion around JuliaCon will take place.
        You'll need to make a Discord account if you don't have one (the process
        below will prompt you to login to or register for Discord). Your Discord
        nickname will be set to the name you used when registering for JuliaCon
        in order to promote an air of authenticity and professionalism among
        attendees.

        If you’re comfortable using the designated main track/hallway channels
        to direct questions to presenters, please do so. This way everyone can
        benefit from the answer you get! Attendees are encouraged to request new
        channels to create gathering places for those with specific interests
        (e.g., #web for attendees interested in applications of Julia to the
        web). Let us know in #request-a-channel if you’d like a new text or
        voice channel. To report issues, please contact an organizer (blue) or
        moderator (green) on Discord. Organizers are identifiable in the user
        list on Discord.
